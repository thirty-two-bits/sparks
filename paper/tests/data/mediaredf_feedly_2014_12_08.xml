        <title type="html">What "product" means in tech</title>
        <published>2014-12-07T09:16:33Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://scripting.com/2014/12/07/whatProductMeansInTech.html" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Product&lt;/i&gt; is an evolving idea, a moving target -- which is why it can be so confusing. Not just to people in news, but also to people in tech. If you want to understand, here's my story of how we got to today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shrink-wrap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software used to come in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrink_wrap"&gt;shrink-wrapped&lt;/a&gt; boxes. Inside the &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2014/12/07/binder.png"&gt;box&lt;/a&gt; -- disks and a book. A registration card. The box sold to users for anywhere between $49 and $800.&lt;img src="http://scripting.com/2014/12/07/radio.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were print magazines. The magazines wrote about products, products ran ads. A full page ad cost up to $50K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were retailers, physical stores, where you could buy computers, and they also carried software. Eventually there would be software-only stores like Egghead. And there were primitive social networks called Compuserve, AOL, MCI Mail, AppleLink where people told stories about products they liked or didn't like. There weren't any ads on these networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were software distributors, who the dealers bought software from, at a discount. Three big ones: Softsel, Ingram and Micro-D. Eventually the stores and distributors were replaced by mail order, and that, as far as I know, is where the shrink-wrap story ended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Websites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next came the web. Instead of products, we had websites. A whole new way to develop software. The software couldn't do much compared to what the desktop stuff did. Simple text editing, that was about it. Eventually the mainstays of the shrink-wrap world would show up as browser-based productivity apps like Google Docs. (I don't know how Office-type software sells these days? Do the users buy direct from the vendors?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Snacks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next transition -- apps and app stores. I think of these as snacks. All of them single-function little products, their entire UI must fit on a phone screen, not integrated with the others, creating little worlds (functionality-wise) with huge user bases, in the hundreds of millions in some cases. In the shrink-wrap days a successful product would have hundreds of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Productivity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=303081419899270&amp;amp;set=a.113966572144090.1073741828.100005922431565&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&amp;amp;notif_t=like"&gt;Productivity &amp;quot;snacks&amp;quot; seem to be the next thing about to happen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://scripting.com/2014/12/07/shriek.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And probably after that, the users will want integration, where the data from one app can be used in another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which may lead to &amp;quot;snack suites.&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's why we're gravitating to larger-screen phones, to allow the software to get a little more complex. (That would be a good thing, imho, as a software developer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The unit of news&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, it seems to me the unit used to be the &lt;i&gt;edition&lt;/i&gt; -- an instance of the newspaper or news show for broadcast media, published once every 24 hours, that contained &lt;i&gt;sections,&lt;/i&gt; and within sections &lt;i&gt;stories. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the story stands alone, and is distributed as a unit by Twitter, Facebook, RSS and whatever else comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a student of news could provide a rough timeline at how this evolved?&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

        <title type="html">The Technology Sectors that Create the Most Value</title>
        <published>2014-12-07T16:00:00Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.tomtunguz.com/top-250-it-companies/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/images/top_250_it_companies.png"&gt;&lt;img width="100%/" src="http://tomtunguz.com/images/top_250_it_companies.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In which sectors have software companies created the most financial value? I asked myself this question over the weekend. I categorized the top 250 IT companies which spans $675B in market cap (AAPL) to $3B in market cap (ASOS) and created the chart above. B2B Software, which includes Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and SAP among others represents about 30% of the total IT market cap today. The consumer web (GOOG, FB, Baidu, eBay) is second at 20% of market cap. Semiconductors and Consumer Hardware (led by Apple), tie at 17% each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these very valuable companies are older than I thought. Below, I’ve plotted the year of founding of each of these 250 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/images/3b_by_decade.png"&gt;&lt;img width="100%/" src="http://tomtunguz.com/images/3b_by_decade.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13% of the top 250 IT companies today were founded before 1950. On the other hand, companies founded since 2000 account for 19% of the stock tickers but only 10% of the market cap. In other words, these younger, newer companies are smaller on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from being a great decade for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cosmeticsideas.com/1980s-fashion-trends/"&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;, the 1980s saw the founding of today’s largest IT companies with a median of $9.3B in market cap across 24 companies including AAPL, ORCL, MSFT, SAP and EMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next ten years, I suspect we’ll see the next generation of B2B Software companies rise to the same levels of market caps as these big names. The opportunity to replace these companies’ aging technologies is simply massive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/images/3B-yof.png"&gt;&lt;img width="100%/" src="http://tomtunguz.com/images/3B-yof.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break these trends down by sector as a proxy for innovation rate. Not surprisingly, the most valuable Consumer Web companies have all been founded after the invention and widespread adoption of the internet. B2B Software is also witnessing rapid innovation with big companies built in the last 10-20 years, which supports the idea that we’ll see some huge SaaS businesses in the future. In contrast, Financial Services hasn’t seen a new $3B+ company created in a while, indicating there’s likely quite a bit of opportunity here. LendingClub’s pending IPO will change this to a certain degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B2B Software will remain the biggest category by market cap for a long time implying there are huge opportunities there for new SaaS startups to disrupt.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

        <title type="html">Epicness in Hip-Hop: A Video-Art History</title>
        <published>2014-12-03T13:26:04Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/rashaad-newsome-explores-epicness-in-hip-hop.html" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">&lt;img src="http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/12/03/seen/03-raashad-video.o.jpg/a_190x190.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes music “epic”? Artist Rashaad Newsome has been pondering that question with his latest art video, which makes its debut at Miami’s SELECT art fair tonight and features a soundtrack comprised of a remix of Carl Orff’s &amp;quot;Carmina Burana.&amp;quot; Described by New York &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; critic Anthony Tommasini as “a human cry against cruel fortune,” the choral and orchestral work features one section, O Fortuna, that’s become so synonymous in media with full-blown impending doom that it’s now almost a pop-culture joke — cued up whenever the judges make their entrance on &lt;i&gt;The X Factor&lt;/i&gt;, whenever Shrek heads to a bookstore, and whenever actors, in a slow-motion montage, bite into things covered with chocolate spread in a Hershey’s commercial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsome was fascinated by the way &amp;quot;Carmina Burana&amp;quot;’s larger-than-life narratives overlapped with narratives found in hip-hop. Orff’s piece, he said “is based on these pagan poems that are about the sinfulness of wealth, drugs, gambling — and about the rise and fall from greatness.” He added: “Knowing that this incredible piece of music that has been celebrated for over a century in some way mirrors music from my area and my community was really satisfying for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making art out of those connections, Newsome surveyed staff at Hot 97 and 105.1 to see who the most epic emcees of all time were. He then analyzed video clips of the emcees’ performative gestures onstage and in music videos and timed them to Orff’s piece. The results: a six-part video displayed in the round tonight at SELECT, along with a live performance by Mykki Blanco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of my work plays with so-called high and low culture,” said Newsome, who’s become well-known in New York City for his art about vogueing culture (including his annual King of Arms vogue ball, which this summer was staged Riverside Park). And his next show immediately after Miami — at New York’s Marlborough Gallery — continues his own unique mission to merge high and low. For that exhibition, which opens next week, Newsome’s created video that juxtaposes baroque architectural references with street dance: “There are voguers in the piece, but I also I worked with breakers and pole dancers. I wanted to work with all these rogue dance forms that are not as celebrated the way that modern contemporary dance forms are celebrated — and inject them into the conversation about architecture, which is a very high-art idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video preview of Newsome’s work, Icon, is here:&lt;/p&gt;

        <published>2014-12-07T11:48:53Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://feed.torrentfreak.com/~r/Torrentfreak/~3/9inqiTZubyI/" type="text/html"/>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://torrentfreak.com/piracy-theft-movie-industry-workers-speak-out-141207/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">The mantra often heard from Hollywood's leaders is that pirates are thieves. However, not all people in the industry feel that way. Today we present the views of four regular filmmakers on this controversial topic, what the impact is on the industry, and what can be done in response.&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com"&gt;TorrentFreak&lt;/a&gt;, for the latest info on &lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/category/copyright-issues/"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/category/pirate-talk/"&gt;file-sharing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-services-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2014-edition-140315/"&gt;anonymous VPN services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago we published &lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/why-hollywood-director-lexi-alexander-sides-with-pirates-141118/"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Hollywood director Lexi Alexander in which she explained her support for file-sharers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resulted in a lively discussion on Twitter and other media, so we decided to explore the topic a little further. Instead of letting movie industry bosses speak, we solicited the thoughts of various filmmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just as many opinions as there are people working in the film business and we aimed to cover a broad spectrum. Our main goal is to show that the piracy issue isn’t as black and while as it’s sometimes portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real challenge, perhaps, is to let people have their say without condemning their views. While this won’t solve the issue it’s a good way to move forward. That’s true for both “sides” of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the four filmmakers who were kind enough to participate and answer five questions about piracy, how it affects the movie industry, and what can be done in response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/joshua.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="75" alt="joshua" width="75" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/joshua.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joshua Caldwell &lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshua_caldwell"&gt;@Joshua_Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;) won an MTV Movie Award for Best Film in 2006. Recent films he produced, wrote and directed are Layover (2014), Resignation (2014) and Assassin (2015). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/kevin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="75" alt="kevin" width="75" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/kevin.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Koehler:&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevrockcity"&gt;@kevrockcity&lt;/a&gt;) is a screenwriter whose work has been featured on the Hollywood blacklist. He worked with several well-known filmmakers including Wim Wenders and Gregg Araki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/brent1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="75" alt="brent" width="75" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/brent1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brent Weichsel&lt;/strong&gt; (@&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bsweichsel"&gt;bsweichsel&lt;/a&gt;) is a Local 600 camera assistant. He worked on several popular movies and TV-shows including Person Of Interest and White Collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/johnkent.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="75" alt="johnkent" width="75" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/johnkent.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Kent&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johndoctorkent"&gt;@JohnDoctorKent&lt;/a&gt;) works as a producer at Potent Media. He is known for his work on the films Booley (2010), Deer Crossing (2012) and Apocalypse Kiss (2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do you think piracy equals theft?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joshua Caldwell:&lt;/strong&gt; No. I believe the Supreme Court has been &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3901205964610715556"&gt;very clear&lt;/a&gt; on the issue of whether file-sharing constitutes ‘theft’ or ‘copyright infringement.’ I harp on this because it seems to be the core argument from a lot of people. “It’s stealing. They’re thieves.” Even when presented with this ruling they say, “Well, I don’t believe that.” Okay, well the court system you’re supposedly relying on to “enact justice” on file-sharers does, so now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an important distinction for me and how I think about this issue because of how it frames file-sharers. It’s a psychological thing. Thinking of someone as a thief is very different than thinking of them as an infringer. It’s much easier to think of a ‘thief’ as being an inherently bad person who must be punished by the law. Not to say that those who infringe upon copyright aren’t subject to consequences, but as a creator, I think of them as audience that we just haven’t been able to capture yet. So, I start from a place of “Why?” and ask questions in search of solutions rather than “sue them all and put them in jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Koehler:&lt;/strong&gt; No, they are not equivalent. Piracy is copyright infringement. I know this is a boring, pedantic answer. Sorry. However, while it is not theft, it is taking compensation from the folks that make the content and shifting it to the folks that distribute the content – not just piracy sites, but also legal streaming sites (Netflix, Spotify, iTunes, et cetera) who can leverage the threat of piracy into more favorable deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brent Weichsel:&lt;/strong&gt; Piracy in and of itself is not theft. It’s also not a loss. Studies have shown that people who pirate often spend far more money on media than those that do not. Now if you make money because of your piracy well that’s a gray area where I do not know what to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Kent:&lt;/strong&gt; Piracy of media is theft, in the legal sense of the word, but I do not think it is always “illegal”. Films and television shows are created for corporations and investors to realize a financial return, or for artistic purposes. The financial return cannot be realized if the media is experienced without viewers paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a financial return, no further media can be made. So everything can’t be free. However, there are thousands of hours of media which would be lost without YouTube, from old television shows their corporate masters no longer wish to exploit to a commercial fondly remembered from childhood. Should the films which were owned by Vestron Video in the 80s be lost forever because they are now a line item on the sheet of a corporation which put them out of business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal stance and practice is that if a film or television show is available from the legal owner for a fee, it should be paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do you think piracy is affecting the movie industry?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joshua Caldwell:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s affecting it without a doubt. Whether it’s doing so to such a degree that it’s having an overall impact? I don’t think we know for sure yet. For one, the jury’s still out on whether it has a negative or positive impact. On a film-by-film basis, it’s easy to suggest that it might have a negative impact, but for the industry as a whole? It’s hard to make that case when the films that make the most money at the box office are also the most pirated. No one complains about piracy when the movie does well, but when a movie tanks and it was leaked online, it becomes an easy place to point fingers. And yes, I’m sure it has some impact; but at the same time, maybe the film just wasn’t very good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t say for sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the audiences that most studios rely on for box office aren’t file-sharers. I mean, &lt;a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/google-moviegoing-infographic/"&gt;/Film recently posted&lt;/a&gt; about how 70% of moviegoers don’t plan on a specific movie when going to the movie theater. It’s really, really difficult to equate a free download to a lost sale. There are just too many other factors. But piracy is an easy target for blame specifically because no one really knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, if piracy is as harmful financially and as widespread as is being argued, I can’t figure out why you would want to alienate such a large audience further than you already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Koehler:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it has certainly helped obliterate the movie industry’s former business model, which was based around theatrical distribution (followed by timed DVD and television broadcast releases). This is no longer a workable model, so the industry is in search of a new one. For some releases – large studio tentpoles, franchised, with branded tie-ins, often in 3-D – they’ve found a successful model. For other kinds of films, they’re still looking, which is why the studios have stopped making certain genres altogether. Piracy isn’t the only reason, obviously, but it’s a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brent Weichsel:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s become a scapegoat. People blame dwindling sales on it. The studios use it as an excuse to pay the crew and talent less. Producers use it in negotiations to have shittier contracts with the unions. Has it had a truly negative impact that doesn’t have to do with its perception? Probably not much. Not any more than the folks selling dvds or VHS on Canal Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Kent:&lt;/strong&gt; Piracy has an effect on the film industry in different ways, depending on the genesis of the film. Downloading “The Avengers” probably doesn’t hurt the movie – it made a billion dollars in the theaters, and millions more through the secondary revenue streams. The people who worked on the film were paid for their work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piracy might kill off some sequels – the revenue that would have made the studio heads greenlight part two was lost in no-pay downloads. But what I can tell you for sure is that piracy hurts the independent filmmaker financially. I produced a direct-to-DVD movie called DEER CROSSING – a horror film, no artistic masterpiece, but something people might want to kill an evening watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first week of DVD release, on one popular torrent site only, there were over 30,000 downloads of the film. How many of these downloads could have been paid rentals or DVD purchases? When you add this to the deals that distributors offer for independent films, there is no way to make back the money the investors put in – and forget about a profit or paying off deferred deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at the office, we end up screening a fair number of “inspirational” talks, stories of mighty challenges overcome and then shared onstage to serve as an inspiration to others. The point being: If &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; can overcome my problems [modest pause], what can &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; do? [applause]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stella Young — comedian, activist, awesome person — was simply having none of that. She was not planning to serve as anyone’s inspirational porn of the month, and in her &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much?language=en"&gt;fiery, hilarious talk&lt;/a&gt; — given at TEDxSydney in the city’s famed Opera House this April — she laid into the stereotypes that she fought all her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some choice &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much/transcript?language=en"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was teaching in a Melbourne high school, and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said, “Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?” And I said, “What speech?” You know, I’d been talking them about defamation law for a good 20 minutes. And he said, “You know, like, your motivational speaking. You know, when people in wheelchairs come to school, they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?” (Laughter) “It’s usually in the big hall.” And that’s when it dawned on me: This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have seen the little girl with no hands, drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth. You might have seen a child running on carbon-fiber prosthetic legs. And these images, there are lots of them out there, they are what we call “inspiration porn.” And I use the term &lt;em&gt;porn&lt;/em&gt; deliberately, because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people. So in this case, we’re objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people. The purpose of these images is to inspire you, to motivate you, so that we can look at them and think, “Well, however bad my life is, it could be worse. I could be that person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that quote, “The only disability in life is a bad attitude,” the reason that that’s bullshit is because it’s just not true. No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp. Never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stella Young died unexpectedly on December 6, 2014. She was 32. She wished to be no one’s inspiration. YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/94385/"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/94385/" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;amp;blog=14795620&amp;amp;post=94385&amp;amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDBlog/~4/ftaEFJj2ey4"&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore are members of a select club.  For them, names like &amp;quot;Edge,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Search,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Days,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;World Turns&amp;quot; mean something. They came of age at a time when soap operas were a big deal, and as they tell it, soaps provided an opportunity for some of their best raw acting. Now Moore, who has performed in everything from independent films to widely-released big budget classics like &lt;em&gt;Boogie Nights&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;, stars alongside Baldwin in the acclaimed drama, &lt;em&gt;Still Alice.&lt;/em&gt; She plays a linguistics professor who starts forgetting her words as Alzheimer's sets in. This isn’t the first time the two have shared the screen—Moore’s also famous for her cameos as Baldwin’s high school sweetheart in &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;. Hear two actors reveal why they do what they do, and how the decisions they’ve made have gotten them where they are today.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;img height="360" alt="Man with megaphone" width="640" src="http://img.qz.com/2014/11/man-with-megaphone.jpg?w=640"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.justbakedshop.com/our-story/"&gt;Pam Turkin quit&lt;/a&gt; her job as VP of Marketing for a major merchandising firm, people were shocked to hear why: She was finally turning her passion project into a business by opening a cupcake shop in her hometown of Detroit. Today—after testing numerous flavors on her family and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.squareup.com/"&gt;accepting credit cards with Square&lt;/a&gt;—her &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.justbakedshop.com/"&gt;shop, Just Baked&lt;/a&gt;, is a chain with several locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s stories like these that grab &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kbrooklyn"&gt;Khobi Brooklyn’s attention&lt;/a&gt;. As Director of Product Communications and Marketing at Square, part of her job is to surface amazing anecdotes to amplify the company’s marketing efforts to an extremely broad audience—i.e. everyone who sells things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what makes Brooklyn’s job so hard: She needs to get Square’s products in front of everyone from farmers market sellers to surfing instructors to barber shop owners. In this exclusive interview, she shares her tactics for marketing a product to extremely diverse audiences—including those that don’t care about what’s hot in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define your audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Square’s audience is so massive, it needs the help of a very diverse press—countless publications focused on niche trades and topics. Most startups are consumed with getting coverage in major publications like The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times. But smaller publications in local markets can have a compounding effect and actually allow a startup to get closer to their potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We strive to build products that anyone could use at scale, because Square started small too,” says Brooklyn. “Everybody should have access to this type of tool, no matter what they’re selling or how much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when there’s no easy way to appeal to everyone at once, it’s important to define a core group to speak to directly so you can pick up adjacent customer segments along the way, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find and divvy up your core customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to start somewhere, and it’s always wise to go with what you know. Because Square’s roots are in tech and the Bay Area, it initially started out marketing its card reader to local merchants and people who would immediately understand the technology. Not only was the barrier to entry lower in this region, but the customers they landed were also fairly influential (and social media savvy), helping to spread product awareness to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever your company starts, Brooklyn advises capitalizing on what you know about the people around you. What are their habits like? Where are their pain points? How can you get your product in front of them in a way they’ll be receptive to? Once you figure this out and have a strong local customer base, you have social proof to work with to market to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Square, focusing on Silicon Valley couldn’t go on forever—the company’s ambitions to be an essential tool for vendors everywhere meant going global. To make this larger audience less overwhelming, Brooklyn suggests breaking it into verticals and observing what happens in each. “With verticals, you can determine which type of customers are making the biggest impact, or where your products resonate the most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Telling our story by showing how our customers are actually using the product is extremely effective.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Square has verticals for the fashion industry, sports and recreation, food service, and many more. This allowed Brooklyn to notice that beauty shops were one of the company’s fastest growing customer bases. Now, whenever a new product feature launches that could support this vertical in particular, she’s sure to make the rounds with the press specific to their line of work. When Square launched its appointment management tool, Brooklyn gathered testimonials from salon owners that use Square about how the feature has become a cornerstone of their business. This is a powerful strategy when appealing to prospective customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Telling our story by showing how our customers are actually using the product is extremely effective—it shows how valuable Square is,” she says. “Instead of saying ‘this is how it works,’ we’re able to show it, and that’s how businesses start to identify with how they could use the product too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The media isn’t just one thing. It’s made up of a lot of different channels. So, before you even begin, you have to take a step back, look at your product announcement, and then figure out why it would be important to the reporters you want to reach,” Brooklyn says. “The number thing you need to do is help the reporter understand why it’s going to be valuable for them to tell their audience.” Use this as your guideline to figure out which reporters to reach out to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this in mind, Brooklyn suggests three techniques that can help you achieve broad media coverage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Meet customers where they live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Business owners read a wide variety of publications from local newspapers to business-specific websites. All of these outlets can be used to your advantage, you just have to identify which publications are the most popular and influential within each of your verticals—starting with the ones you’d consider core to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not in that world, beauty trade magazines like Hair Salon Today or Nails Mag might seem abstract, but people read them—a lot of people,” says Brooklyn. “You need to immerse yourself in each of these areas and figure out who people are listening to. That’s the only way you’ll get their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Build relationships with the right reporters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the biggest mistakes you can make is blindly calling a reporter. You have to do your research—first on the media outlet, and then specific journalists. Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is this outlet’s focus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How wide of a net does it cast? How big is its viewership or readership?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it cover any other topics that are relevant to your company? Can you use that to your advantage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do people rely on the outlet for advice or decision making?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your answers to these questions make the outlet a worthy target, focus on finding the reporters that work there who have the highest probability of covering what you do. Make a spreadsheet where you can capture their names, their contact information, and any articles that they have already written either about your company or similar companies, subjects, or markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You want to tell a reporter, ‘I know you’ll find my product interesting because you’ve covered X, Y and Z before.'”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to word your initial contact (ideally over email, reporters hate getting called out of the blue), so that it sounds like you’re helping them. You know they like writing about your subject area. As a result, you know their audience probably likes hearing about it. The reporter wants a larger audience—play into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re reaching out to a reporter who you haven’t worked with before, don’t forget to explain where you’re coming from. Tech startups have a tendency to assume that every media outlet will be interested in what they’re doing. But local papers and broadcast stations don’t cover tech with the same interest as TechCrunch. They don’t care how much VC money you’ve raised or recognize executive names. You have to convince them that you’re relevant and useful to their viewers or readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you have to start at the beginning, then hone in on why this is important information for their audience to have,” says Brooklyn. “You want to constantly demonstrate relevancy throughout the conversation. Every piece of information we share needs to be paired with why it’s relevant. This isn’t just a piece of technology, for example, it’s a tool for beauty and spa owners to increase their revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Remember, reporters are people too. They have a goal. They have a boss. They’re busy. Figure out how to make their lives easier.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you keep this idea front and center, you have a much better chance of cultivating friendly, mutually-beneficial relationships with reporters who will then want to work with you when you have news to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When reporters are behind schedule with 50 unread messages in their inbox, they’re going to prioritize the ones that make their day that much simpler and help them do their job,” says Brooklyn.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Always ask yourself how you can help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could include providing executive quotes, customer testimonials, screenshots of product features, and related statistics (Square often shares data about small businesses, for instance). If you package all of this up for a reporter who already has a demonstrated interest in your field, your chances of getting a positive story are vastly increased. You don’t have to be afraid of journalists or assume an adversarial posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s this funny stigma that PR people are just spinning a story, but we’re not—we’re telling a story, and reporters want to do the same thing. That’s why they appreciate it when you can help them tell a better story,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you’ve wrapped one story with a reporter, don’t just let the interaction die. Follow up with them to see if they’re interested in any other angles, or even if you can selflessly help them another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ask them, ‘What are you interested in? What are you working on now? Are there any facts you’re still looking for?’” says Brooklyn. Not only will this help you build a durable relationship, it’s actually a learning opportunity. “Reporters are out there talking to a lot of different people from a lot of different companies. They might know something you don’t that could be really relevant to your business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, when you catalog a journalist’s interests, you can become a better resource for them on future projects. “It doesn’t have to be transactional. It doesn’t have to be, ‘I have this piece of news and I need you to help me get it out.’ It should be, ‘What is going on in your world, and how is what I’m doing relevant to what you’re doing? What is happening that your audience wants to know about, and how do we fit in?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The local approach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t underestimate the power of local newspapers. “Every town across the US has a regional publication that hundreds or thousands of people read over coffee to get the news,” says Brooklyn. But the relationship you have with these types of outlets needs to be different that those you have with beat reporters who cover technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I can’t just call a reporter in Little Rock and say, ‘I work at Square,’ and expect them to drop everything.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I was going to do this, they’d most likely say, ‘I don’t know who you are and why I should care. We’re dealing with a light post that fell across a major intersection.’ Click.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break through this wall, you want to research the geographic market you’re targeting. Just like you’d look into a reporter’s background to see if they’d be right for your story, you want to gather information about the local economy, area trends, demographics, other recent news stories. Can your product hook onto any of these? For example, if small businesses appear to be shuttering in a certain part of the country, there’s a story Square can tell about helping local merchants boost their margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the best way to get the attention of local outlets is to give real-world examples. Pitch a human-interest story about an existing local user, and use that as a springboard to talk about why more people should check out your brand or product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do the legwork to show examples of how customers are already using your product to do something important—for us, it’s boosting local economies,” says Brooklyn. “The point is to surface information that the reporter doesn’t already know and then make it about the customers, not your product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landing amazing customer stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Square’s marketing team focuses on seller stories because their success means success for the company too. It’s invaluable proof that the product works, people love it, and it’s already made a difference for someone who is relatable to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We often work very closely with our sellers when putting together communications materials, because the success of small businesses is what the Square brand is all about,” Brooklyn says. Not only does the company push these stories out through their social media channels (and a lot of video content), but Brooklyn often connects them directly with reporters so they can share their experiences completely unfiltered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One risk involved in telling customer stories is that you might overshadow the people with your product. Don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Your brand is just one piece of the story you want to tell, not the center of it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Square, our role is to address the pain points of running a business, and then make it easier wherever we can,” says Brooklyn. “If we can take some of the challenging stuff out of it so that business owners can focus on other things, like diversifying their inventory or their own marketing efforts, then that’s a win. That’s our story, not the product itself, but the idea of giving people the tools they need to be more efficient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this spirit, a lot of the marketing material Brooklyn and her team produces is geared toward helping Square customers thrive. This includes blog posts full of tips about how storefronts can use different features on Square register, tweets about trends relevant to this market segment, and a lot of content that doesn’t have anything to do with the companies’ products at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We might run a post about how sellers can get more out of their social media, or what they can do to retain existing customers. If you can be a resource without constantly trying to sell, you can build a long-term relationship with people.” When you do, those customers are more likely to spread the word to their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn admits that the ROI on this kind of content can be hard to track—it’s pretty impossible to figure out how each new customer decided to convert. But you can and should track engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can see how much of a post typically gets read, if something gets shared, how many people clicked through to watch a video or read more,” she says. “Use these metrics to try new content styles, see what works, and modify what doesn’t to maximize how many people are seeing your content.” More eyeballs mean more clicks, which translate into more buys. For any startup that’s hesitant to invest in marketing or content, Brooklyn says it’s well worth the effort. Your payoff will be valuable, long-term customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to show how much you value your customers. We try to take every chance we have to celebrate small business owners because that’s core to who Square is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivate new audiences further afield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Brooklyn first joined Square, the company’s marketing and communications focused on two areas: corporate communications (big hires, financial announcements) and product communications (new features, launches). But in order for the company to grow, she knew they had to focus more on communicating directly with even more stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To build this kind of strategy, she offers four steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify your different audiences:&lt;/strong&gt; “You’re not just speaking to your customers. You have to market to your investors and prospective employees to keep your company growing. What is your most immediate need? Which audience do you need to speak to in order to fill that need?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailor your message:&lt;/strong&gt; “Your company should have one core message that all of the messages you send can roll up into. At Square, this message is that the company can help people manage their businesses better anywhere,” says Brooklyn. “But for each of the audiences you’ve identified, you need to figure out a way to tweak your message to answer their questions, fit their needs, or resonate with them in some deeper way.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be on the lookout for new audience opportunities:&lt;/strong&gt; “Building out your audience is a progression. With each new product or feature you introduce, you need to think very carefully about how it might change people’s impression of the brand, how you tell that story to make it consistent, and what people will want to know about it to feel good about it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to reach as many different audiences as possible with each announcement:&lt;/strong&gt; “You can’t expect one story on TechCrunch to do all of your work for you across all of your users,” says Brooklyn. You have to put yourself in your audience’s shoes and really psychologize what they would want to hear in order to take action. “If I’m an investor, I want to hear something very different than a writer for Glamour.” One of the most helpful tips she’s discovered is visualizing the headlines you want for each of your audiences before you even launch your PR strategy. If you can hold this in mind, your chances of sending that message are much higher. Knowing the headline you want can also help you choose which media outlets to focus your energy on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching more and new audiences is just as much about varying your content type as it is about mixing up your message. While many young, early-stage companies can’t produce slick videos, visual content doesn’t have to be elaborate and can really extend your reach. Photos are by far the most shared type of content on Facebook, for instance, and that doesn’t take more than the camera on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that you use metrics to monitor which campaigns were successful and where,” says Brooklyn. “We’re constantly looking at how our content performs on different platforms. Did more people engage with a photo or video through email? Or on social? For our Facebook posts, do more people click through if there’s an image or a video?” She’s seen firsthand how beautifully-designed, fun, playful pieces of content drive greater engagement and sharing. “Making your content shareable is how you get in front of new people the fastest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more chances you give people to understand your brand, the more people you’ll pull into your orbit. This is one of the major benefits of producing different types of content. “We’re all really busy people—small business owners are even busier—so a great image that communicates something in one shot is often very effective. People may not have the time to read an eight-paragraph blog post, but they’ll share a flow chart that says basically the same thing on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking people’s attention spans into consideration is most important when it comes to video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“People will watch a video for 30 seconds or maybe 2 minutes, but definitely not for 5 minutes.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, no matter what you do, don’t make a video simply for the sake of making a video. Just because other startups have one doesn’t mean yours needs one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s all about respecting your audience’s time. Yes, you want to send your message, but this respect should also be evident.” To make written content more digestible, Brooklyn suggests keeping your layout simple. Make sure there are images to draw attention, and strategically use bullets to make key points more salient. Maybe you bullet a story in a preview over email and allow people to click through for more information. You want to simultaneously give them the ability to understand your message quickly and choose to drill down for more if they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You want to avoid having a list of deliverables just because other companies do things. Not every announcement requires a press release, video, blog post, tweet, landing page, etc.,” says Brooklyn. “Really be conservative when you ask yourself what you want to accomplish. Now, what are the channels that you really need to nail in order to do that? Work backwards. Focus your efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She recommends answering the following questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you trying to do with a piece of content? Send a message? Make people share? Make people perceive the brand a certain way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who will engage with it, and who do you want to attract with it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the content educational? Inspiring? Aspiring? How does this impact which channels you put it on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basically, at the end of the day, what is the point?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have strong answers for all of these questions, you probably don’t need to spend the time it takes to create that piece of content,” Brooklyn says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this logic, Brooklyn decided to put together a photo spread to profile Just Baked, the Detroit cupcake bakery. She also worked with owner Turkin to offer quotes that highlighted how she used Square register in a unique way, and how it helped her expand her business. The company even featured her as a panelist to speak directly to prospective customers about her experience at an offline event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not always having 17 deliverables that will make the difference,” says Brooklyn. “Sometimes it’s just one thing—one core piece of content, one tweet, one conversation with one reporter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to scale as your company scales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve made an impression on your core audiences and have inroads to new ones, you have to keep going. You need to not only maintain traction with markets you’ve cracked, but increase it over time. Here are a few tactics Brooklyn recommends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow with your customers.&lt;/strong&gt; As she does with Just Baked, Brooklyn checks in on the customers she’s worked with in the past to keep tabs on how their stories are unfolding. Not only does it keep them engaged, but it also helps her scan for new story ideas that could be good for the press or to share through another channel. “One of our sellers in Cleveland started a taco truck after he lost his job, and it eventually grew into a popular brick-and-mortar restaurant,” she says. “We promoted his success story as a way to connect with the Cleveland community, acknowledge the challenges in the economy, and demonstrate how Square can help.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for new ways people are using your product.&lt;/strong&gt; Brooklyn keeps her eyes peeled or Square sellers with businesses that haven’t typically used the products before. “For example, we found a fly fishing shop that uses Square, and that’s so unique,” she says. “With that we were able to reach out to new people, new publications, new reporters, and capture some really great photos and videos that drive home our main point—not that Square is great for fishermen, but that it can be used anywhere.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continually test new ways to campaign.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you experiment with locally-hosted offline events, direct response TV, morning shows, or internet forums, keep pushing the envelope to find new customers. You don’t know when you’ll luck into your next pocket of super fans. And as soon as a campaign works and nets a few customers, talk to them, learn their stories, and repeat them back to the same audience to get the flywheel spinning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always be thinking, ‘What’s the next story people will want to hear? Okay, now how do we get there?’”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="html">Building Brand Loyalty in the Digital Age</title>
        <published>2014-12-08T07:00:00Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.psfk.com/2014/12/how-do-you-build-brand-loyalty-in-the-digital-age.html" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-259347" href="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Jeremy-Dipaolo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="468" alt="Jeremy Dipaolo.jpg" width="468" src="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Jeremy-Dipaolo-468x468.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of an ongoing series, PSFK chats with alumni from the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sva.edu/"&gt;School of Visual Arts&lt;/a&gt; (SVA) Masters in Branding program. The final former student in this year’s series is Senior Manager of Global Brand Design at PepsiCo &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://branding.sva.edu/students/class-2011/jeremy-dipaolo"&gt;Jeremy DiPaolo&lt;/a&gt;, who was “quickly seduced” by the multifaceted program. He tells us that brands “have it rough” in the digital age, and with the rise of the Internet of Things, may be in “an interesting pickle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What made you decide to enroll in the Masters in Branding program? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a young designer, I did mostly product, package and environmental work for entertainment and lifestyle clients. After a few years in, I grew frustrated at how little influence I had as a “downstream” designer on brands I was passionate about. The &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://branding.sva.edu/"&gt;Masters in Branding&lt;/a&gt; appeared at a moment when I was craving what it had to offer, and I was quickly seduced by the mix of disciplines that make up the program: behavioral economics, design strategy, business development, cultural anthropology. This is the program’s core strength, and really, what helped me learn to decode and leverage what’s happening out in the world to design more meaningful experiences for people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is it about our current society that makes branding so important?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, brand building was a one-way, “push” approach. Awareness building through repetition of message and image was the predominant method to grow a brand. Create a catchy jingle and play it twice an hour, conjure the perfect sticky tagline or design the perfect logo to put on a t-shirt or bumper sticker, and watch the brand catch fire. The message was constant, consistent and controlled by a select few.&lt;br&gt;
The distribution of media has permanently modified the DNA of how brands are built and managed today. Tools for creation are bountiful (YouTube, Vine, Instagram and Facebook) and readily accessible. We as consumer/producers have become far more proactive in creating and therefore more sophisticated in how we consume branded signals. It’s a more intuitive and subtle practice than in previous decades…with almost everyone an active participant. Even the concept of what a brand is has shifted to become more personal, less commercial and institutional. The result is a market where nuance, irony, reference, narrative and personality are replacing clever, catchy and campaign-y. For better or worse, branding as a practice is woven into the fabric of how we interact with each other. To understand branding now, at this very moment, is to understand people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How has having a Masters in Branding degree helped you to further your career?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met so many incredible minds at SVA: classmates, faculty, Design Matters guests who would stick around after Debbie’s interviews and answer our burning questions. For a year and a half, we were a commune exchanging big ideas, and many of us continue to carry that fire. It was an incredible network, and remains a core part of my life. A big part of that also stemmed from the experimental nature of the inaugural year of the program. We all had to buckle in and support each other along the way.&lt;br&gt;
The relationships I formed through the program are what have impacted my career the most. Having an amazing group of people who’ve had a similar experience to spar, challenge, consult, comfort and share victories with has been so critical. They’re the sounding board when I need advice, the people who still provide inspiration through the work they’re doing and shape how I engage and interact with my co-workers and collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the most surprising thing you learned about the process of branding during your time in the program?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest takeaway for me was just how multifaceted branding is as a practice. I found a rich toolkit for inspiration and execution in binding together the disparate domains of business, behavior, culture and creativity. A solid handle on all these aspects is required to design, build and manage brands today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Based on your experience analyzing major brands like Starbucks, Facebook and Playboy, what overlapping quality of these leading brands do you believe ties into their success?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re each dedicated to creating rich experiences. They do this by providing the flexibility for people to shape how they use the product or service. Whether you subscribe to Playboy for the articles (really) or the pinups, post images of puppies or political tirades to Facebook, or decide that Starbucks is your office when you’re on the road, the use case is supported by the brand.&lt;br&gt;
It’s worth noting that it’s very difficult to allow that kind of freedom without losing a real sense of what the brand stands for. Though Starbucks and Playboy are culturally anchored and people have a good sense of the brands, they’ve had their share of struggle in maintaining definition over the years. Facebook has only been around for a decade and has shape shifted a lot as generations of users have moved through the platform. I think Facebook will face the biggest challenge of the three in maintaining a sense of what the brand means to people and what its future looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you believe brands can best adapt in the digital age?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brands have it rough in the digital age: the competitive set is growing for everyone as startups and homespun brands are sharing the stage with the big guys. With the fragmentation and distribution of media, branded signals are more diffused on the whole, but can catch fire without warning. One misstep can mean disaster, but one triumph is no guarantee of success. The landscape makes it harder to create impact with messaging or image alone. So it all comes down to creating meaningful experiences for people. Focusing on the fundamentals of product functionality, service excellence and dedication to quality at a time when much of the marketplace is speculation, hype and hot air is a serious strategic advantage.&lt;br&gt;
The best out there are realizing this. Young brands like Android, Airbnb, Dollar Shave Club and even some larger, more established organizations like PepsiCo, Delta and Starwood are investing considerable energy and capital to develop user experience in total, connecting to the needs of people to innovate and drive brand value. The whole system has to work together—product, service, delivery, message—for any brand to be credible, compelling, enduring and deliver lasting returns.&lt;br&gt;
It’s definitely an exciting time to be in this industry. The digital nature of the market will no doubt continue to provide complexity for brand adaptation. The advent of the Internet of Things, where brands will compete on being the most invisible and intuitive may leave &lt;i&gt;branding&lt;/i&gt; in an interesting pickle. How do you build loyalty for a brand you—by design—almost never actively engage with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name two brands you think are standout examples of innovation in terms of their branding strategy, and tell us why.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.acehotel.com/newyork"&gt;Ace Hotel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; I wrote my application essay for the program analyzing this brand, and I am still obsessed. From the way they select their cities at just the right cultural moment, to the teams they use to shape and restore their spaces, to the brands they collaborate with, to the incredible programming and most importantly for the fact that they hardly advertise. It’s a brand that’s innovative in the way it isn’t trying to be innovative. They’ve created amazing spaces in amazing cities and live the brand, creating passionate communities along the way.&lt;br&gt;
Their design also tends to be way ahead of the cultural curve. Look at the Palm Springs property by Commune in 2009. It calls upon a 1970s California desert fantasy with the right mix of flash and utilitarian restraint. A macramé sculpture made from eight miles of rope adorns the lobby. I can buy macramé sculptures at Urban Outfitters in Brooklyn right now, five years later…they’re that far ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="381" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-04 at 5.33.28 PM.png" width="573" src="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-04-at-5.33.28-PM.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/"&gt;LEGO&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;It’s a beloved and inventive product brand that’s grown into a beloved content brand. It’s hard for building blocks to go out of style since they’re so simple and fun, but the way LEGO continuously reinvents and extends the brand experience through content partnerships is more than a little brilliant. The LEGO Movie was a lot of fun, the video game franchise (LEGO Star Wars is a personal favorite) keeps growing and their retail experience is best-in-class…they’re speaking a relevant language to users of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-259349" href="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10273674_571190639661007_4652326233617437955_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="464" alt="10273674_571190639661007_4652326233617437955_n.jpg" width="700" src="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10273674_571190639661007_4652326233617437955_n-700x464.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you had to offer one key piece of advice to interested applicants, what would it be?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come to the program with an open mind and a thirst for debate. The amazing late-night conversations with classmates carrying a multitude of perspectives will sharpen your thinking and move your ideas forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the one lesson you learned during the program that you use today in your job on a daily basis? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to pinpoint one lesson from the program that stood out over the others. It was an incredibly rich time filled with complex dialogue, debate and exploration of how to connect people meaningfully with brands and experiences. I’m fortunate to work on a wide variety of engagements at PepsiCo, ranging from strategic platform innovation all the way to very concrete design to get products and services to market. It’s an exciting and varied role that allows me to actively pull from all aspects of the program. It was a great foundation that has continued to be of service in many ways over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My older cousins from Minneapolis had an Intellivision. And cable. And MTV. And scrambled The Movie Channel which you could kind of make out every few seconds. Which to a country bumpkin like me was certainly sufficiently advanced technology. Anyway, I loved playing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Deadly_Discs"&gt;Tron: Deadly Discs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!"&gt;Pitfall!&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBqyjl1gkVw"&gt;Kool-Aid Man&lt;/a&gt; on the Intellivision whenever I was over. &lt;a title="return to article" href="http://kottke.org/#fnref:1418047767"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I’m here to talk about 3D printers; engineering; the future of how things are made and anything else. AMA! &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Oh man I am so excited that you are doing an AMA! One of the hardest decisions of my life was choosing to pursue a degree in computer science over architecture. I have always hoped to eventually work on designing CAD software as it combines my love for both programming and drafting. My Question:
The majority of my experience lies in developing algorithms to efficiently make use of clustered systems. Do you see this being an increasingly useful/marketable skillset as computer clusters drop in price, becoming increasingly accessible to the companies that make use of Autodesk's tools? Thank you so much for taking the time to do this! P.S. I would also like to say how much I appreciate that the Autodesk suite is free for students. It has provided me with invaluable experience in software that would be otherwise out of my financial reach. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly computer design is the language of architecture. The coolest thing that I see happening in architecture is the combination of using computers to do design, like generative design to make more interesting buildings.  We’re also starting to see the use of software that drives output like robots that do fabrication of architecture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://interviewly.com/i/carl-bass-dec-2014-reddit"&gt;Read Full Interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <published>2014-12-08T08:23:02Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://recode.net/2014/12/08/vox-medias-jim-bankoff-says-he-knows-what-makes-you-click-video/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">He's got $110 million (so far) riding on it.&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=recode.net&amp;amp;blog=61371898&amp;amp;post=107229&amp;amp;subd=recodetech&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Code-Media-San-Francisco" src="http://recodetech.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/codemediasanfrancisco-jim-bankoff.jpg?w=600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you build a digital publishing giant in a world dominated by Facebook and iPhones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Bankoff is trying to figure that out, and he thinks he has a pretty good start: Vox Media, the company behind sites like the Verge and SB Nation, has 150 million readers a month and $110 million in venture funding. The CEO says the company will turn a profit next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Bankoff visited our final &lt;a href="http://recode.net/event-coverage/codemedia-series-san-francisco/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code/Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; evening event of 2014, at the Automattic headquarters in San Francisco, and &lt;a href="http://recode.net/2014/12/04/jim-bankoff-says-vox-media-is-content-publisher-for-a-new-generation/"&gt;chatted about his strategy and tactics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a pretty good conversation, in part because Bankoff is a lively interview — he had a spirited defense, for instance, to my assertion that we are collectively overvaluing the notion that publishers are technology/product companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was also good because the crowd at our event had some pointed questions for him. For instance: Does the future of publishing involve &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7332411/fart-flatulence"&gt;lists about farts&lt;/a&gt;? (Answer: Probably! Why not?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you’re interested in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen/status/541929714840256513"&gt;inside — deep inside — digital media baseball&lt;/a&gt;: Bankoff and Vox are frequently compared to BuzzFeed, with good reason.  I made the link last week &lt;a href="http://recode.net/2014/11/30/yet-another-big-funding-round-for-a-big-web-publisher-this-time-for-vox-media/"&gt;in a story about them&lt;/a&gt;, and brought it up again onstage. But I don’t remember Bankoff taking a swipe at BuzzFeed during our 30-minute conversation. Feel free to look for any evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, Heaven was missing some Angels. The Victoria's Secret Angels, to be a little more precise. In their annual show (including the legendary diamond bra), the most beautiful women on the planet walked the runway in some strange, wild, but always sexy lingerie. Unlike years past, the show was held in London, an ocean away from the &lt;em&gt;GQ &lt;/em&gt;HQ. Thankfully, we were able to enlist the help of models Joan Smalls, Lindsay Ellingson, and Lily Donaldson to take over our Snapchat (we're gq_magazine) and give us a backstage pass. Here's what they snapped, and don't worry, we'll be bringing you the full show shortly&lt;/p&gt;

        <published>2014-12-06T12:50:12Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/shirts-robes-and-sweaters-as-art-in-miami.html" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">&lt;img src="http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/12/06/seen/06-carl-0lede.o.jpg/a_190x190.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to Art Basel Miami Beach a few dozen blocks to the south, NADA's more the &amp;quot;downtown&amp;quot; fair — downtown in both the traditional sense of the word, meaning Manhattan's Lower East Side, where many of these galleries are located back in New York, and the new, metaphoric sense, extending along the L train and then continuing on, with express stops in East London, West Paris, and East Berlin, and anywhere else a clever young man can sport a scruffy beard, sallow complexion, and normcore eyeglasses and still get laid above his genetic station. As a shopping, dining, and dating aesthetic, it's very much up my alley, and that goes to its art — curation, too, since it's the fair where I actually know some of the gallerists and artists who show there from my life outside of writing about art and hanging out at art fairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NADA takes place at the Deauville Resort, which is one of those mammoth cruise-ship-run-aground hotel complexes in Miami, built in the 1950s and gone slightly to seed. It's many blocks north from the main fair and is a nice comedown after its oligarchic aura of holy-object self-seriousness. People at NADA seem to be having a good time. You can find things like Graham Collins's bronze cast sculptures of salty snacks (potato chips, what looked like Fritos; for some reason it reminded me of the petrified remains of the everyday of an abruptly lost civilization; Williamsburg's Journal Gallery had them), as well as Andy Coolquitt's oddly moving diorama of antiperspirant bottles (at Lisa Cooley, whose HQ is on the LES).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, NADA's informality seems to create its own anti-seriousness enforcement mechanisms and social codes. There can be a vague feeling that some of what you see there is just casting about, a suspiciously lazy determination to invest the everyday with profound (if deadpan) meaning. Which is why I kept wondering at all of the items of clothing that were on display as art in so many of the booths. Is making art out of, or what looks like, shirts, robes, and sweaters a trend? Sure seemed like it. I have no explanation for it in terms of why. But lots of booths could have doubled as closets.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who will be returning are most of the leads: star Justin Theroux, estranged wife Amy Brenneman, lover Carrie Coon, kids Margaret Qualley and Chris Zylka, as well as Christopher Eccleston who plays a former reverend. Everything is still in flux, though, so it's not entirely certain who's in and who's out, or what capacity they'll appear in. At the very least, we know we still have Theroux's bulge, &lt;a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/only-uplifting-thing-about-the-leftovers.html"&gt;which lifts us up on high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Learn exactly how the actress is nailing pregnancy fashion.&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=observer.com&amp;amp;blog=35584880&amp;amp;post=439396&amp;amp;subd=nyoobserver&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title="The Secret to Blake Livelys Maternity Style" height="600" alt="Ms. Lively at L'Oreal Paris's Ninth Annual Women of Worth Celebration at the Pierre Hotel on Dec. 2.

(Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since announcing her pregnancy through a &lt;a href="http://observer.com/2014/10/coco-rocha-and-blake-lively-announce-their-quirky-aspirational-pregnancies/"&gt;gorgeously filtered Instagram photo&lt;/a&gt; on her lifestyle website, Preserve, the actress and aspirational glamour-girl-next-door Blake Lively has not been shying away from cameras. Instead, she has appeared, looking incredibly blissed out, at several benefits and even at a talk with her bestie idol and next-door neighbor, Martha Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title="The Secret to Blake Livelys Maternity Style" height="600" alt="At thE God's Love We Deliver Golden Hearts Awards on Oct. 16.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Michael Kors)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At most of these events, she has chosen to wear long, figure-hugging gowns that don’t leave much to the imagination. She is not afraid to show us how her pregnancy is progressing, and she’s even down to bare some cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title="The Secret to Blake Livelys Maternity Style" height="600" alt="At the Angel Ball, hosted by Gabrielle's Angel Foundation at Cipriani Wall Street on Oct. 20.

(Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Gabrielle’s Angel Foundation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing on these red carpets with looks that could put her non-pregnant contemporaries to shame, Ms. Lively has totally nailed maternity dressing, and we think we have figured out her secret…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, Ms. Lively is dressing while pregnant the same way she dressed before: in sleek, glamorous dresses, without shying away from colorful accessories. Obviously, her being tall, leggy and gorgeous helps. But her method is inspirational for everyone — why should women change their style while pregnant? In Ms. Lively’s case, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=observer.com&amp;amp;blog=35584880&amp;amp;post=439396&amp;amp;subd=nyoobserver&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">They say that when Jean Genet made occasional visits to London after the war his first stop was always the Rembrandt room in the National Gallery, to see Self-Portrait at the Age of 63. The portrait is dated 1669: Genet believed it was the last Rembrandt painted. (Not true, apparently.) He wrote a short essay called ‘Rembrandt’s Secret’ for L’Express in 1958, and in his unfailingly Manichaean way he wanted to convince his readers of Rembrandt’s goodness. This is what the picture made manifest, he felt. Goodness as a quality of character, primarily, looking evil in the face.</summary>

        <summary type="html">It now appears as if senators will get the opportunity to vote on a presumed-dead cybersecurity bill before the lame-duck session ends, a key lawmaker and a congressional source said on Thursday.

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It now appears as if senators will get the opportunity to vote on a presumed-dead cybersecurity bill before the lame-duck session ends, a key lawmaker and a congressional source said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Senate failed to move forward on a bill overhauling the National Security Agency’s authority last &lt;a href="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/11/19/with_reform_bill_dead_nsa_set_to_lose_some_surveillance_powers_in_june"&gt;month&lt;/a&gt;, hope that senators would consider the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, which passed the House in July, faded. However, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/225994-senate-may-move-soon-on-cyber-bill"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Thursday he expects the Senate to move on the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A congressional source close to negotiations on the bill confirmed McCaul’s comments to &lt;span&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/span&gt;. If it passes the Senate, the bill then heads to President Barack Obama’s desk for signing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCaul’s “staff has been in negotiations with Senate staff for months now,” the source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If passed, the bill would &lt;a href="http://homeland.house.gov/NCCIP-Act"&gt;allow&lt;/a&gt; private companies to share cybersecurity data with the Department of Homeland Security. The bill also outlines Homeland Security’s role in American cybersecurity and would reauthorize the department’s authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would also give legal protection to private companies that share information with the federal government. All government agencies would also be required to tell Homeland Security about any cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congressional source said that the bill was “&lt;a href="http://www.rollcall.com/issues/53_27/-20011-1.html"&gt;hotlined&lt;/a&gt;” in the Senate, a little-known procedural move meant to speed a bill’s passage. For legislation to successfully be “hotlined,” the Senate majority and minority leaders must agree to pass the bill by unanimous consent, which bypasses a roll-call vote. The leaders then inform members of their decision using a “hotline” phone installed in each senator’s office. Members then have a specified amount of time, which sometimes can be must minutes, to object. If there are no objections, the bill is deemed passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House has no similar mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re hopeful we’ll get through the hotline process,” the source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCaul told Capitol newspaper the &lt;em&gt;Hill&lt;/em&gt; that the legislation is the “most significant piece of cyber legislation that’s been passed by the United States Congress.” Privacy advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, back it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of movement on the bill comes in the wake of a &lt;a href="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/12/02/did_north_korea_finally_get_revenge_for_team_america_world_police"&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; of Sony Pictures Entertainment that exposed employee information, Social Security numbers, passwords, and movies. Investigators suspect North Korea is behind the attack, although an unnamed North Korean diplomat denied Pyongyang’s role in the breach Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

        <published>2014-12-05T11:45:00Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.vice.com/read/larpers-have-created-a-real-hogwarts-school-in-poland-015" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">[youtube src='//www.youtube.com/embed/jw3n0no5Un8?rel=0' width='640' height='360']&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.larping.org/portfolio/harry-potter-larp/"&gt;A video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Organized by Denmark's &lt;a href="http://rollespilsfabrikken.dk"&gt;Rollespilsfabrikken&lt;/a&gt; and Poland's &lt;a href="http://www.liveform.pl/en"&gt;Liveform&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.larping.org/"&gt;LARPing&lt;/a&gt; communities, the &lt;a href="http://rollespilsakademiet.wix.com/college-of-wizardry"&gt;College of Wizardry&lt;/a&gt; simulation gave super fans an experience thousands of times more satisfying than buying overpriced butterbeers at the &lt;a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/Theme-Parks/Wizarding-World-Of-Harry-Potter-Offer2.aspx?s_tnt=184140:2:0"&gt;Wizarding World of Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;: the chance to escape the Muggle world and, for four days, become students and teachers in a 24/7 magical academy, &lt;a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1648298/harry-potter-larp-experience-hogwarts-in-real-life/"&gt;learning spells, playing Quidditch, and engaging in hyperbolic emotional intrigue&lt;/a&gt; with their fellow witches and wizards. And thanks to the intense and sophisticated LARPing community and resources of Northern Europe, this fantastical reality is set to open its doors once more next spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People role-play Harry Potter all the time, and the College of Wizardry organizers openly admit on the event's website that what they're doing is just an extension of daydreaming or make-believe. &amp;quot;It's essentially the same as when kids use curtains as robes and sticks as wands and run around pretending to be witches and wizards,&amp;quot; they write. &amp;quot;Except we're grownups with nicer costumes and a lot of experience in designing interactive experiences with each other.&amp;quot; That translates to uniform and finely tailored robes, ties issued to participants in the colors of one of five school houses (although set in the Potter universe, the game took place at the fictional Czocha College of Witchcraft and Wizardry, not Hoggy-Warty-Hogwarts), and manuals and guidelines for how to interact over the course of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The immersive detail of this magical reality is something you'd probably never be able to create in the American LARPing world. Here simulations are more &lt;a href="http://www.vice.com/en_dk/read/LARP-harder"&gt;weekend-warrior fantasy creations&lt;/a&gt;—a lot of slash-and-hack battles giving folks an opportunity to channel some aggression into foam swords and fireballs. It's the sort of thing you'll see in the 2013 film &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/knights_of_badassdom/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knights of Badassdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the Poles and their neighbors devote serious time and energy to developing new worlds, not just battles. In 2012, a Polish LARP squad called the Brothership of Sorontar from Glogowka announced their plan to develop &lt;a href="https://bienia.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/larp-theme-park-in-poland/"&gt;Kraina Pradziada, a full-time, Tolkein-themed LARP park&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an already functional LARP park, &lt;a href="http://utopion-bexbach.de/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Utopion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in Bexbach, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/harry-potter/11269845/harry-potter-wizard-school.html"&gt;Poles have wanted to pull off a massive Harry Potter LARP for ages&lt;/a&gt;, but they never had the resources to hire a castle and create all the kit. That's why they called in the Danes: the true kings of LARPing. Rollespilsfabrikken, an association of 1,000 dues-paying members with a physical headquarters and armory in Copenhagen, is just one of &lt;a href="http://howtolarp.blogspot.ie/"&gt;dozens of Danish LARP organizations partially funded by state grants&lt;/a&gt;. With 100,000 Danes involved in the practice, LARPing is the third-most popular organized activity—behind soccer and handball—in the nation. The Danes have even &lt;a href="http://io9.com/this-danish-school-teaches-through-larping-and-it-wo-1612307468"&gt;experimented, in the town of Hobro, with education-through-LARPing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Danish organizers of the Harry Potter simulation state that they're disciples of the &lt;a href="http://nordiclarp.org/what-is-nordic-larp/"&gt;Nordiclarp movement&lt;/a&gt;, which is all about creating a convincing world and then dumping characters into it unscripted. Without prompting, there's no guarantee that the good guys will win, no telling how the scenario will play out. That freedom, they hope, will make wizarding feel real, create engaging stakes in the events, and perhaps dig up new emotions and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This ethos undergirds their mission statement for the Wizarding event: &amp;quot;We want the LARP to feel like you're stepping into the world of Harry Potter. Emotional drama, school rivalry, young adults fighting the battles of adults, and occasional comedy are all part of the experience... We want drama, escalation of conflicts, and de-escalation back to normalcy again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also known as bleed, this obsession with the leakage between reality and fantasy and altered emotional states has in the past been taken to more extreme ends in Denmark than the fight against Voldemort. In 2008, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDl5zZ0oo4s"&gt;&amp;quot;Motherland&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; simulation envisioned Denmark ruled by Nazis in a reality where the Allies lost World War II and subjected participants to simulated torture. In 2011, the $40,000, two-day &lt;a href="http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2012/larp/"&gt;&amp;quot;Kapo&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; simulation attempted to teach Danes the reality of a paranoid police state by having them recreate the conditions of Jews brutalized in concentration camps and then coerced into degrading and dominating their fellow prisoners. The LARP, intended to explore the roots of human cruelty, involved simulated gang rapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thank God for now they're only interested in exploring the teenage angst and juvenile excitement of the wizarding world. But we'll have to see what they cook up next: The same team plans to reopen their castle-cum-academy twice more in the next year, April 9–12 and 16–19, inviting another 114 participants and additional non-participant observers to get as close to Hogwarts as it's possible to get. So anyone 18 and older who'd like to receive his or her belated, digital owl had better sign up now and figure out how to get to rural Poland in the spring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

        <title type="html">The New Republic and the Beltway media's race problem</title>
        <published>2014-12-05T11:50:02Z</published>
        <updated>2014-12-05T11:50:02Z</updated>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.vox.com/2014/12/5/7339473/new-republic-race" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jx7y7MBQAy_ANIjYCH9B2o2P3sk=/0x75:3000x2075/400x267/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/44282842/104623476.0.0.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's little doubt that The New Republic's young owner, Chris Hughes, treated its beloved editor, Frank Foer, poorly. Hughes' new CEO, Guy Vidra, criticized Foer's leadership while sitting right next to him at an all-staff meeting. Hughes hired a replacement before firing Foer — which Foer had to learn about through rumors. Hughes, a newcomer to journalism who bought his way, publicly humiliated Foer, along with also-fired literary editor Leon Wieseltier. It's an ugly, unkind way to treat an editor, an employee, and the well-respected leader of a newsroom. Much of the publication's masthead, outraged, has resigned in solidarity and protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hughes' predecessor, Marty Peretz, did much worse. In the years of Peretz's ownership, from 1974 to 2007 and then partially until 2012, he gave himself the title of editor-in-chief and regular space in the magazine and on its website, which he frequently used to issue rants that were breathtaking in their overt racism. The columns typically came during periods of turmoil for the minorities he targeted: often blacks and Latinos, later focusing especially on Muslims and Arabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;A publication that buoyed racism was tolerable. a publication that fired two beloved white men was not.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelmingly white writers and editors who worked for Peretz knew his work was monstrous, and often struggled over the morality of accepting his money (as did I, during my brief internship there). But none ever resigned en masse as they did over the firing of two white male editors today. That fact is just a particularly egregious example of a much larger problem among the elite Beltway publications: a lack of diversity and a begrudging tolerance of racism that go hand-in-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here are the sorts of things that Peretz wrote or said over the years; all but the speeches here ran on the New Republic's pages or website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoted speaking on the &amp;quot;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/09/footnotes-on-the-new-republic/63677/"&gt;cultural deficiencies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;the black population&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing statistics on out-of-wedlock births among blacks, Martin Peretz, editor in chief of The New Republic, said, &amp;quot;So many in the black population are afflicted by cultural deficiencies.&amp;quot; Asked what he meant, Peretz responded, &amp;quot;I would guess that in the ghetto a lot of mothers don't appreciate the importance of schooling.&amp;quot; Mfume challenged Peretz, saying, &amp;quot;You can't really believe that. Every mother wants the best for their children.&amp;quot; Peretz agreed, then added, &amp;quot;But a mother who is on crack is in no position to help her children get through school.&amp;quot; Some in the audience of 2,600 young Jewish leaders hissed at Peretz's remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing on the &amp;quot;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://prospect.org/article/my-marty-peretz-problem-and-ours"&gt;lives of Africans&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that no one has ever really cared about the lives of Africans in Africa unless those lives are taken out by whites. No one has cared, not even African Americans like [Jesse] Jackson and [Susan] Rice. Frankly -- I have not a scintilla of evidence for this but I do have my instincts and my grasp of his corruptibility -- I suspect that Jackson was let in on the diamond trade or some other smarmy commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing on the &amp;quot;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-spine/no-special-envoy-no-crisis"&gt;deficiencies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;Latin society&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am extremely pessimistic about Mexican-American relations, not because the U.S. had done anything specifically wrong to our southern neighbor but because a (now not quite so) wealthy country has as its abutter a Latin society with all of its characteristic deficiencies: congenital corruption, authoritarian government, anarchic politics, near-tropical work habits, stifling social mores, Catholic dogma with the usual unacknowledged compromises, an anarchic counter-culture and increasingly violent modes of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far his worst screeds, though, were reserved for Muslims and Arabs, whom he famously argued should all be &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/77475/the-new-york-times-laments-sadly-wary-misunderstanding-muslim-americans-really-it-sadly-w"&gt;stripped of free speech rights&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, frankly, Muslim life is cheap, most notably to Muslims. And among those Muslims led by the Imaam Rauf there is hardly one who has raised a fuss about the routine and random bloodshed that defines their brotherhood. So, yes, I wonder whether I need honor these people and pretend that they are worthy of the privileges of the First Amendment which I have in my gut the sense that they will abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &amp;quot;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070211174921/http:/www.tnr.com/blog/spine?pid=58683"&gt;higher standards of civilization&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; (that most telling pronoun) hold than do Muslims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually believe that Arabs are feigning outrage when they protest what they call American (or Israeli) &amp;quot;atrocities.&amp;quot; They are not shocked at all by what in truth must seem to them not atrocious at all. It is routine in their cultures. That comparison shouldn't comfort us as Americans. We have higher standards of civilization than they do. But the mutilation of bodies and beheadings of people picked up at random in Iraq does not scandalize the people of Iraq unless victims are believers in their own sect or members of their own clan. And the truth is that we are less and less shocked by the mass death-happenings in the world of Islam. Yes, that's the bitter truth. Frankly, even I--cynic that I am--was shocked in the beginning by the sectarian bloodshed in Iraq. But I am no longer surprised. And neither are you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no one resigned — including me, while I &lt;span&gt;was an intern at the magazine for four months. Though I was unpaid, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I eagerly accepted the resume-boosting prestige that came from working there. And, like the rest of the staff, I did it knowing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; it meant turning a blind eye to Peretz's frequent screeds on the magazine's website, fully aware that they were not just the crazy rants of an old racist but were in fact palpably damaging to the minority families who had to live in a society that was that much more intolerant because Peretz enjoyed a platform that legitimized his views. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am thinking about this today as I watch senior editors and contributing editors resign en-masse from the magazine, in response to the firings of Foer and Wieseltier. Many of them are friends, and many never worked under Peretz at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a number of the journalists who are resigning their positions as &amp;quot;contributing editor,&amp;quot; typically an honorific title granted to former staffers who are no longer actually contributing or paid, did work under Peretz, or did accept this same honorific title from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these resigning editors chose to tolerate and lend tacit support to Peretz; I am in no position to critique them for this. But the fact that many of them found Peretz's promulgation of racism to be tolerable, whereas Chris Hughes' firing of two beloved colleagues was not, speaks to a larger problem of how we think about racism in American society and particularly in the elite media institutions that have badly lagged in employing people of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Peretz's rants were easy to ignore: their victims were comfortably out of sight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally heard and saw a number of today's resigning editors deride and privately object to Peretz's racism, sometimes quite forcefully. But, to my knowledge, not one of them, including senior editors who could find a new job with ease and contributing editors who drew no salary at all, thought it was as resignation-worthy when Peretz repeatedly wrote that Arabs have lower &amp;quot;standards of civilization,&amp;quot; that blacks have an inferior &amp;quot;culture,&amp;quot; that Latinos are lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, on the day when Hughes fired two well-off white men from the publication, two men whose talent and prestige will see them through to a new position, a half-dozen or so contributing editors who saw fit to retain their titles through years of Peretz's racism immediately resigned their positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to attack those who tolerated Peretz but not Hughes, nor is it to impugn their characters; to any degree that they even can be impugned, I am just as culpable. But the bigger picture is that the two editors who were fired this week are white and privileged; so are, overwhelmingly, the contributing editors who resigned their honorific titles this week. The New Republic, itself, is overwhelmingly white. And the magazine is not alone: the grand journalistic institutions of Washington, DC, have had this problem for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a big part of why Peretz's rants were so easy to ignore: their many victims were, if you worked at The New Republic or a similar publication, comfortably out of sight. Any injury they suffered was easy to overlook. The fact that these editors felt such pain for Foer and Wieseltier highlights just how little pain they felt for Peretz's non-white targets. None could muster the same outrage, the same public denunciations, the same grand gesture on behalf of the black, Latino, Arab, and Muslim communities whose frequent public degradation they — we — tolerated for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among black journalists on Twitter, there's been a somewhat less pained reaction to The New Republic's collapse. And there's been some awe at the outrage that DC media has mustered on behalf of The New Republic's current staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run cover stories questioning the intelligence of 40 million people, because of their skin color, some among them tend to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
— Ta-Nehisi Coates (@tanehisicoates) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tanehisicoates/status/540634982893772800"&gt;December 4, 2014&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that there are two parallel conversations among journalists about this magazine, almost totally separated by race, further demonstrates the degree to which Washington's elite political publications are often not by, for, or about people of color. That doesn't mean their editors agree with Peretz's racism — they don't — but it's why it was easy for them to shrug it off in a way that Hughes' closer-to-home mistakes are not. &lt;span&gt;A publication that buoyed anti-black, anti-Latino, anti-Arab, Islamophobic racism was tolerable. A publication that fired two beloved white men was not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">&lt;strong&gt;Naomi Wolf&lt;/strong&gt; said on CNN today that if more victims of sexual assault want to see justice done, they need to go public, identify themselves, and publicly identify their attacker.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="naomi wolf" height="210" alt="" width="320" src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/naomi-wolf.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naomi Wolf&lt;/strong&gt; talked with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mediaite.com/power-grid/person/?q=Michael+Smerconish"&gt;Michael Smerconish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on CNN today and said that if more victims of sexual assault want to see justice done, they need to go public, identify themselves, and publicly identify their attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolf was going off the &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; report fallout, and charged that college campuses “use the anonymity that victims are encouraged to want as a way to avoid liability, to avoid transparency, to… hide any open reporting of sexual assault statistics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smerconish found it a little strange someone viewed by many as a feminist champion would be telling women to fight in public. Wolf acknowledged the backlash she’s gotten, and pointed to how she went public in 2004 accusing a Yale professor of “sexual encroachment.” And Wolf said that experience showed her just how secretive college campuses can be when it comes to keeping such things under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://digiday.com/sponsored/turnbcs-why-big-data-is-really-about-small-insights/"&gt;Why big data is really about small insights&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://digiday.com"&gt;Digiday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a world of hyper-connected consumers, big data is the foundation of marketing “magic.” Marketers previously gathered this data on consumer behavior through individuals – focus groups, test audiences, secret shoppers, even two-way mirrors. By observing individuals, marketers were able to understand subtle nuances in consumer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, marketers glean those nuances from data and analytics, and to do so, they need a lot of it. Just as more pixels allow digital photographers to zoom in on subtle background details with clarity, a wealth of data allows marketers to find granular insights on audience behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data, one automaker we worked with found that consumers who spend more than a minute and forty-five seconds on its website tend to buy a car within 10 days. As a result, the car maker decided to tailor its web content to ease those users down the funnel and toward a sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, a Turn client, a European pay TV provider, learned how it could customize its web content to user interests, even for users it had never seen before. Soccer fans saw its sports package while sitcom viewers got highlights from popular family shows, setting new relationships off on the right foot and turning browsers into subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples show how small insights delivered by big data can make a meaningful difference to a brand’s bottom line. They’re about the value of not just knowing your customers – but of knowing what to do with what you know about your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how your brand can do the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find your audience and build on it. &lt;/strong&gt;Lots of customer data comes through your pipeline, so put it to work. Combine first- and third-party data to create personas from the full spectrum of your known audience, then use modeling to find, attract, and engage consumers that share key characteristics with your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop talking; start listening. &lt;/strong&gt;We think a lot about how technology can help deliver the right message to the right customer. But that’s only half the battle. Smart marketers don’t just talk to their customers; they also listen. Just look at the great example set by Starcom and how they’re helping Kraft understand the habits of millions of visitors to Kraftrecipes.com to serve them up relevant content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="feedlyNoScript"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Please enable Javascript to watch this video&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re lucky to live in an age where our customers provide us with lots of information about their interests and aspirations. Use that to your advantage. Hear what they have to say, and respond to them with marketing that answers their specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure what matters. &lt;/strong&gt;Rather than relying on traditional branding metrics and measurement to judge the power of your marketing, think about what matters most. Are you hoping to increase brand loyalty and recall? Or do you really want to drive an increase in sales?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using offline sales metrics to assess the impact of your online marketing can reveal the true impact of your efforts and their real ROI. Don’t save measurement for the tail end of your campaign, either. Make it a part of your culture, and check in frequently to ensure that everything you do aligns to your specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join forces.&lt;/strong&gt; Choose the right technology and agency partners for your long-term success, and then work with them to set and achieve shared objectives. Together, learn from your results and see what’s working and what needs to be fine-tuned. Then look at where spend should be adjusted, and – most of all – where messaging and creative can be refined and adapted to deliver a better, more engaging content experience for your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer data can and should be much more than an overwhelming volume of bits and bytes; smart marketers understand that it’s a trove of information about current and future customers. Knowing what to do with that information can transform your relationships with those customers and act as a boon to your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s your insight?&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a particularly hard week. Long. Cold. Rainy. Exhausting. A lot of sleepless nights. Nervous energy that sapped the body of its own spark. Four board meetings. More meetings and meetings. Some exciting times hanging out with friends, old, new and newest. The whole week was like a whirligig. There are holiday parties everywhere. I don’t want to attend them. I just wanted to sit at home, read a good book, listen to Miles and just let my mind wander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whenever my mind wanders, I find myself thinking about the profession I have left behind.It has been eight years since I touched cigarettes. It has been eight years when the craving is in the back of my mind. Reporting too, is a narcotic, one worse than nicotine. It never leaves you. Whenever I have that craving, I do one of the two things — either get into an email discussion with one of my ex-editors or I end up watching one of the three movies about media: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men_(film)"&gt;All The President’s Men&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/shattered-glass/id267649346"&gt;Shattered Glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_Famous"&gt;Almost Famous&lt;/a&gt;. They are movies about idealism, narcissism and innocence of a profession I have now left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Bangs"&gt;Lester Bangs&lt;/a&gt;, music critic and editor of Creem magazine, portrayed brilliantly by late Philip Seymour Hoffman in Almost Famous, was one of my favorite characters in the movie and it was because of the movie, I finally got to learn about him, his work. If you read his reviews, his essays and his interviews, you almost knew the man, but you really didn’t. But what I remember the most about him is when he tells young William Miller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“They’re gonna buy you drinks. You’re gonna meet girls, they’re gonna try to fly you places for free, offer you drugs. I know. It sounds great, but these people are not your friends.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His words are eerily similar to the comments made by David Churbuck, my editor at &lt;a href="http://Forbes.com"&gt;Forbes.com&lt;/a&gt;, who chucked up a promising career in print to go chasing his Internet dream. He left 85 Fifth Avenue in New York, to move uptown by a few blocks to a grimy office above an aging toy store and taking us believers — back when they called us the fools — along for a ride of our life. David was told perhaps a version of those words by his mentor/editor when he was a pup of a reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of media has changed. The method of media has changed. But what media has is supposed to do hasn’t changed. I don’t think that will ever change — in the end what its all about. Change, adapting to it, loving it, hating it, and just rolling with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What David and Lester Bangs have in common, is that they have helped pay forward what is important for the profession to do what it is supposed to do — they have shared the ethos and ethics of the business. Today’s hyperactive media landscape that places less less value on editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have publications where editorial experience is virtually non existent. The value system of the media is what makes it useful, important and brave enough to say what it is supposed to say that. It doesn’t matter if the medium is moving at the rate of clicks or at the rate of one’s mind, what matters is knowing what is the right thing to do. A lot comes from being around smart editors. It is important that we have those folks around to make sure that the next twenty five year old can reach fifty and share that process with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a must read blog post for all aspiring journalists, a &lt;a href="http://www.churbuck.com/wordpress/2014/12/note-to-a-new-journalist/"&gt;Note to a new journalist&lt;/a&gt;, Churbuck writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish I could offer encouraging words about the future of journalism, but it’s no less under-appreciated and challenging than it was in 1980 when I wrote my first piece (on a sewer bond hearing which my editor cut in half and said, “Don’t cry kid. This isn’t a short story about granny’s funeral you know.”). And I hope it is every bit as weird and fun as it was for me — there’s no better place I can think of than a newsroom on a good news day for, as General Gavin said to the nervous paratrooper approaching the drop-zone over Normandy on D-Day: “Buck up son. Don’t be nervous. Don’t you like jumping out of airplanes?” And the soldier said, “No sir, I don’t. But I like hanging around guys who do.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

        <title type="html">The real reason police want to outlaw encryption</title>
        <published>2014-12-06T23:54:47Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/11051/apple-ios-8-encryption/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">Do iPhone users deserve data protection?</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been a whole lot of screaming and fearmongering over &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/google"&gt;Google’s &lt;/a&gt;decisions to encrypt their smartphones by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice is now reportedly considering asking Congress to outlaw encryption that could potentially lock out police, a federal law official &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-30/u-s-seeks-to-reverse-apple-android-data-locking-decision.html"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/i&gt;. This, despite the fact that encryption stymied a record &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/rising-use-of-encryption-foiled-the-cops-a-record-9-times-in-2013/"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt;—yes, &lt;i&gt;nine&lt;/i&gt;—police investigations in the U.S. last year, according to federal records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, for its part, is using the added security of its products as a major selling point. “Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode, and therefore cannot access this data,” the company said in its newly revised privacy policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that might sound like a bit of marketing mumbo-jumbo, it has sparked outrage from law enforcement around the country. So, what does the new security actually mean for police—and for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/iphone/"&gt;iPhone &lt;/a&gt;users, the goal is to give you more ownership over your own data. Apple has done this by fully encrypting any iPhone running iOS 8. As soon as you turn on a password-lock on your device, everything on the phone is protected against all eavesdroppers, whether they be nefarious cybercriminals, eager neighborhood cops, or a pickpocket who nabbed your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 256-bit AES encryption the iPhone offers is a formidable defense. That’s the same encryption the NSA uses for much of its own data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 256-bit AES encryption the iPhone offers is a formidable defense. That’s the same encryption the National Security Agency (&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dailydot.com/tags/nsa/"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;) uses for much of its own data. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack"&gt;According &lt;/a&gt;to Wikipedia, it would take “50 supercomputers” more than 3,000 years to try the “billion billion” decryption keys created by 256-bit AES encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A billion billion keys is off the table, however: Ten wrong attempts wipes the device of all data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of the defense has been slammed by, among other prominent critics, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dailydot.com/tags/fbi"&gt;FBI &lt;/a&gt;director James B. Comey, who said it would place users “beyond the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Comey’s protests and the media’s insistence on calling the encryption “&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dailydot.com/tags/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;-proof,” Apple’s newly secured mobile operating system also keeps out hackers and criminals, groups that Apple users have historically had problems with—including a the headline-making &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dailydot.com/tags/celebgate/"&gt;Celebgate&lt;/a&gt; breach in September, which resulted in hundreds of nude photos of celebrities landing on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple can’t build products that people believe are as secure as their competitors, they’ll lose customers faster than you can say “hacked again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More or less by definition, a backdoor for law enforcement is a deliberately introduced security vulnerability,” Julian Sanchez &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/blog/old-technopanic-new-ibottle"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Cato Institute, “a form of architected breach: It requires a system to be designed to permit access to a user’s data against the user’s wishes, and such a system is necessarily less secure than one designed without such a feature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Apple can’t build products that people believe are as secure as their competitors, they’ll lose customers faster than you can say “hacked again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once you build a back door, you rarely get to decide who walks through it,” Electronic Frontier Foundation activist Eva Galperin &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/evacide/status/514233569980317697"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t simply about locking out the police. It’s about locking out everyone, and giving owners (and no one else) the key to their own data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet this does clearly affect police. Instead of strolling into Apple headquarters with a warrant and getting secret access to the phone, cops will have to take alternate routes. In other words, their jobs just got a bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they’ll have to present a warrant directly to the suspect. Instead of circumventing the alleged criminal, police will take their court order to their front door. If a suspect refuses to allow a warranted search, the police have a plethora of legal options to follow—specifically, holding a suspect in detention for contempt of court. No one can refuse a valid search warrant without suffering a severe penalty, so it’s not as if suspects will walk away with a polite “No thanks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, police can still legally access the data in transit. While data on the iPhone itself will be encrypted by default, data flowing over the phone’s cellular connection is still readily interceptable, given the proper court order—as was the case with previous versions of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t simply about locking out the police. It’s about locking out everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point can’t be emphasized enough. Apple’s cloud storage service, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dailydot.com/tags/icloud/"&gt;iCloud&lt;/a&gt;, remains relatively easily accessible by Apple and police. Many people presumably use the service to store the sort of files and contacts that would be useful in a police investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone’s new default encryption isn’t altogether unheard of—actually, virtually all your devices, from laptops to phones, have had serious encryption options for years. So Comey’s criticisms seem overwrought—but making it the default option is groundbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every step to making encryption easier and more accessible cannot be underestimated. Citizens—criminals and otherwise—will now have significant data protection against thieves and police alike, regardless of how tech-savvy they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, do you think citizens deserve to have their data protected by default?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Online mugshot websites have fallen out of favor with Google—but that doesn’t mean they’re gone.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There may be no truer test of America’s character than whether my friend’s ex-boyfriend Steve (name changed, of course) can ever live down that time in 2011 when he got arrested for a DUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Steve asked her out the following year, she quickly &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/deep-google-online-dating/"&gt;deep Googled&lt;/a&gt; him, as most people do these days before relationships get serious. Steve’s arrest photo popped right up on WVJails.info. “I almost didn’t date him,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve admitted that this was far from the first time his mugshot returned to haunt him. There were other girls who had considered the photo reason to maybe not date him, he told me over &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dailydot.com/communities/facebook/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; message. And he was concerned about it “possibly having a negative effect on job prospects in the future.” Thankfully, he said, the photo “vanished” shortly after he wrote his governor—or, at least, it wasn’t as easy to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online mugshot industry borders on extortion. It thrives of regret and search-engine optimization, often forcing individuals to take proactive action to ensure their name isn’t closely associated with a regrettable moment in their lives. They’re a source of embarrassment for those who appear on them and a target of privacy advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mugshot sites are less likely to be one of the first Google hits than when the industry was rolling a few years ago, but they’re never going to disappear completely. This is a particularly American phenomenon, one where the Bill of Rights—such a defining tool of protection for Americans—is in deep conflict with itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A right to be forgotten?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely you’ve seen the dozens of websites with interchangeable names. Mugshots.com, Busted.com, criminalfaces.com. Each one presents a sea of faces recently thrown behind bars. Most of the people depicted inside are sad or removed; a few are grinning, some are obviously intoxicated. The world of mugshot sites capitalizes on geography at every scale, ranging from national (jail.org, gotbusted.net) to statewide (the aforementioned WVJails.info) to citywide (renomugs.com). Then there are the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HPDNC/photos_stream"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/TucsonPoliceDepartment?fref=photo&amp;amp;sk=photos"&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt; run by police departments that proudly display their big arrests like a hunter showing off a trophy kill. There are even novelty mugshot collections that fetishize arrests, like &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mughots.com/"&gt;mughots.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sites don’t make it clear how they get so many new names and photos so quickly, but jails that fill requests from local media for the previous night’s arrest records sometimes publish PDFs to save their employees the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online mugshot industry borders on extortion. It thrives of regret and search-engine optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Watson, the guy who runs the site that originally published Steve’s story, WVJails.info, also runs the arre.st network of sites, which has a subdomain for 38 states, including West Virginia. Despite attempting to hide his identity by registering the sites through shell companies, he was &lt;a href="http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201301050124"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; in a 2013 class-action extortion lawsuit (settled out of court) on behalf of Ohio residents against five mugshot sites. It’s not a coincidence that he also runs the “reputation management” site U.S. Support Services, LLC, which will scrub someone’s name from sites like arre.st for $60 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with one West Virginia deputy sheriff about such sites. His department didn’t directly capitalize on mugshot availability, like those that put arrestees’ photos on Facebook pages, but he insisted that such records should be in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s weird that there’s a whole industry for it,” he said. “But you journalists can go through and pick through the day’s arrest records, names and charges, and see what’s newsworthy,” he said. “Why should a picture of somebody be any different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once somebody has legal access to those photos, it’s almost impossible to take them down, said Lee Rowland, a staff attorney at the ACLU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First Amendment protections are so strong that once these images are made available, getting them back into the box is extraordinarily difficult,” Rowland said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eternal debate over privacy rights versus those of free expression, Europe famously leans a little more to the former and the U.S. the latter. That’s how the E.U. managed to pass the so-called &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/10319/right-to-be-forgotten-debate/"&gt;Right To Be Forgotten&lt;/a&gt; law, which compels &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dailydot.com/tags/google/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; to honor Europeans’ requests to bury certain unflattering search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, “we’ve seen tons of requests, not just from stores and average people, but from companies trying to hide evidence of past malfeasance, even crimes,” Rowland said. “Even for information like an arrest record, which documents government activity, there’s really no version of the Right To Be Forgotten that wouldn’t acutely violate our First Amendment values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First Amendment protections are so strong that once these images are made available, getting them back into the box is extraordinarily difficult.” —Lee Rowland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A ‘dead’ industry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are about three years too late,” a gentleman who goes by Mugshot Barry, who runs a string of hyper-localized mugshot sites like Shastamugshots.com and Renomugs.com, told me. He was the only one of about a dozen webmasters to respond to my inquiries about who was still in the game and how much money they made. “It is a dead ‘industry.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, he’s right. Since 2011, when &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt; wrote an expose of sites that directly charge visitors to take down their photos, many of the most egregious types of mugshot sites have either closed up shop or changed their model. There’s a number of reasons for this. Several states, like Georgia and Oregon, passed laws to hamper them. The terms of that Ohio settlement required several sites to change their model to no longer directly request payment to take down mugshots. The FBI &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/news_blog/ic3-warns-of-criminals-using-mug-shots-to-extort-victims"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was looking into the practice of mugshot sites that “extort” victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, the private sector got involved. Google changed its algorithm to deprioritize mugshots in search results, and payment companies like Visa and Mastercard pledged to not process money if it was directly for such purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the effect was moderate. Only a handful of states passed such laws before the movement seemed to lose steam, and certainly no federal legislation ever got anywhere. The idea that sites can no longer accept direct payment to remove a photo is laughable, as there’s a clear symbiotic relationship where you still pay a “reputation management” site to take it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of states passed such laws before the movement seemed to lose steam, and certainly no federal legislation ever got anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unquestionably, Google’s algorithm change has helped diminish the online mugshot industry’s ability to defame. That said, Steve’s mugshot &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; still online—I found it with relative ease, though it’s no longer on the first page when you Google his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to an employer I know in Kentucky to see what kind of effects these mugshot sites can have on anyone looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really use mugshot sites as a source when looking to hire somebody,” he said. But just like a prospective suitor, he does Google applicants before calling them in for an interview. “If I just happened to notice an applicant in there that was in the hiring process, yeah, it would deter me from considering them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new ad model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the sites in from “the pay-to-remove era have gone offline,” Mugshot Barry told me. His sites are based on ad revenue from clicks. They take down users if they prove their innocence, and they don’t allow comments “[b]ecause it is not fair to the defendant,” as one reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His sites rely on regular clicks, not from search engines, to make money, he said, and are largely independent. “The Achilles heel is that the individual sheriff department are increasingly declining to release scrapeable data online,” he said. “That results in a slow but steady traffic loss. I’m fine letting the sites die that natural death, there is no reason to hasten it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are all such sites slowly dying? It’s hard to tell. Jason Watkins didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, and the one person with that name in his town in a public phone search didn’t answer or call me back. The number for his “reputation management” company goes straight to voicemail, too. His site looks glitchy, with photos of the same people listed with different names. His &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/WVJails"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; account updates frequently, but it’s clearly a bot doing the work. Watkins have stepped away a while ago, leaving bots do his dirty work for him, scraping and publishing mugshots without his interference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it’s clear that more and more mugshots are still being added to the Internet every day, even if the pace and their searchability has slowed. And the vast majority of those pictures aren’t leaving the Internet anytime soon—at least not in America.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="html">Can police force you to surrender your password?</title>
        <published>2014-12-06T23:55:20Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/11071/police-force-password-cellphone/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">It’s complicated.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While most people by now know—or at least &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; know—the basics on how to protect themselves from cybercriminals, it’s less clear what your rights are when law enforcement come knocking. Can the authorities force you to surrender your passwords at the drop of the hat? Do they have the right to peruse your data at their leisure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many of these things, it all depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where are you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the U.K., you’re tough out of luck. Brits can—and have—been jailed for refusing to surrender their passwords to authorities. In 2014,&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/08/christopher_wilson_students_refusal_to_give_up_crypto_keys_jail_sentence_ripa/"&gt; a computer science student was jailed for six months&lt;/a&gt; after refusing a court order to surrender his password “on the grounds of national security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar Key Disclosure Laws also exist in Australia, with a six-month sentence awaiting those who don’t comply, as well as India (up to seven years), France (three years and $56,000 fine), South Africa (10 years or $180,000), and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, however, there are certain protections in place. U.S. courts have ruled that a password or encryption key are classed as “knowledge”—and that the Fifth Amendment’s safeguards against forced incriminating testimony means there are constitutional protections against being forced to surrender them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How is your data protected?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not get ahead of ourselves—you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; using a (secure) password, right? In October 2014 a Virginia Circuit Court judge&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/virginia-fingerprint-key-disclosure-law-apple/"&gt; ruled&lt;/a&gt; that giving biometric data does not amount to divulging knowledge. As such, and unlike passwords, your fingerprint scan can be taken involuntarily if needs be—much much like a DNA sample or traditional fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who’s asking?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: “Police can’t ‘force’ you to do anything,” points out Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) staff attorney Hanni Fakhoury. “They can ask for you password and you can give it to them, though that’s probably a bad idea without talking to a lawyer first.” Otherwise, it takes a court order to “force” you to do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police can’t search &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/stop-police-phone-search-warrant-warrantless-illegal/"&gt;your cellphone without permission&lt;/a&gt;. Even without a password, they need a warrant to search your device, or they’re breaking the law. (There’s an exemption if they believe the device is under immediate threat of destruction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a tech company protect you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your phone manufacturer/cloud storage provider/encryption software provider is under no obligation to be able to decrypt your data upon demand. When Apple decided that it didn’t want it to be possible for them to decrypt their customers’ data, that was perfectly legal, even if it did make certain people &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/comey-say-apple-encryption-bad-bad/"&gt;very angry&lt;/a&gt;—with one senior police officer&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/police-apple-will-become-the-phone-of-choice-for-the-pedophile-2014-9"&gt; claiming&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone will “become the phone of choice for the pedophile” as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if they &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have that capability, then expect them to exercise it when law enforcement comes knocking, lest they want to be found in contempt of court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;So if I store it myself, is it safe?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only it were that simple. Turning over the password “is pretty clearly protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled incriminating testimony,” advices Fakhoury, but that’s not the end of it. “If the Fifth Amendment protects you, that doesn’t mean the government doesn’t get your cooperation”—meaning you might be expected to decrypt the device, but that anything found on it can’t be used against you in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also depends if the authorities already know what’s on the device. In one case where the defendant was accused of possessing child pornography, law enforcement had already seen some of the files prior to the device shutting down. The defendant was subsequently forced to surrender his password&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf"&gt; on the ground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf"&gt;s that&lt;/a&gt; “providing access to the unencrypted Z drive adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government’s information about the existence and location of the files that may contain incriminating information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the devices under investigation are &lt;i&gt;known&lt;/i&gt; to belong to you, the authorities are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/new-eff-amicus-forced-decryption-unconstitutional"&gt;more likely to push for your password&lt;/a&gt; (even if it is still arguably unconstitutional), as compared to if they were in a shared property where plausible deniability might apply. The upshot of this is that law enforcement’s approach—and the legal recourse open to you—vary a great deal depending on the specifics of each individual case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve reached this point, while you should still theoretically have constitutional protections, in practice there’s little more we can tell you. You should seek professional legal advice. Immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do I do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a good place to start. It’s a nonprofit advocacy group that seeks to “[defend] your rights in the digital world.” It has a&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/issues/know-your-rights"&gt; Know Your Rights guide&lt;/a&gt; last updated in October, and information on potential legal assistance can be found&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;. (Fakhoury has also written in more detail about the legal background; it can be found &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/5359/1/1994-2851-1-SM.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is the American Civil Liberties Union, which aims to “defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and the laws of the United States.” The ACLU can be reached&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.aclu.org/contact-us"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="html">The unlikely allies of the cop-watch movement</title>
        <published>2014-12-06T23:57:14Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/11060/cop-watch-movement-body-cameras/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">After decades of struggle, cops are turning the cameras on themselves.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When George Holliday pressed the record button, the world changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awakened past midnight by the sound of police sirens and helicopters on March 5, 1991, Holliday peaked out from his balcony and captured on his new Sony camcorder a group of Los Angeles police officers breaking Rodney King’s bones with batons and boots while he writhed in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4OauOPTwbqk?rel=0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Holliday gave the tape to local news station KLTV, the resulting outage over the officers’ acquittals sparked the most violent and deadly riots in modern American history. The footage proved the power of police brutality videos and inspired generations of cop watchers to press record. A movement that had only just begun to formally organize one year earlier in Berkeley, Calif., was starting to change the way journalism worked, putting citizens at the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as police departments continued to clash with American citizens across the country, the movement migrated online. Expensive camcorders became cheaper smartphones. Television news gave way to a more democratic YouTube. Sites like the &lt;a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/"&gt;Free Thought Project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CopBlock"&gt;Cop Block&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.copwatch.org/"&gt;Copwatch&lt;/a&gt; organized and rallied supporters on Facebook and beyond. Now anyone can broadcast anything to almost the entire world, and seemingly not a day passes without a new video of police using excessive force or questionable tactics going viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cop-watch movement, designed at first to protect citizens from abusive patrolmen, has been found to also protect the cops themselves from bogus complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the blind spots remain enormous. In Holliday’s video—what some&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/03/05/deggans.rodney.king.journalism/"&gt; consider the first viral video&lt;/a&gt;—the viewer drops right into the middle of the beating, leaving them to wonder what could have led to such brutality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s virtually impossible for random strangers, or even diligent watchdogs, to record an entire event. While some video may be better than none, much of the story is left untold. Investigations still often rely on the he-said, she-said of cops versus civilians, leaving us with a foot firmly in square one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why an unlikely ally has entered the fray of the cop-watch movement—in action if not in name—to finally begin to fill in the most crucial blind spots: the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/patkernel2.gif"&gt;&lt;img height="275" alt="patkernel2" width="550" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/patkernel2.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The context need in Ferguson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ferguson, Mo., police officer &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/darren-wilson/"&gt;Darren Wilson&lt;/a&gt; shot and killed &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/michael-brown/"&gt;Michael Brown&lt;/a&gt; in August, no one pressed record until Brown was already bloodied on the asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of his death were violent riots, vocal distrust, and outright hostility between the predominantly black city and its mostly white police force. The outpouring of grief and rage may have been sparked by this particular incident, but the relationship between Ferguson’s police and its people has been unbalanced since well before Brown died. The inequities extend from the department’s racial makeup to &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/race-and-ferguson-police-visualization/"&gt;data showing&lt;/a&gt; the cops disproportionately target, search, and arrest black people even when white people are found with contraband more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks following the killing, a California-based group called &lt;a href="http://www.wecopwatch.org/"&gt;We Copwatch&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Ferguson to equip the residents of the Canfield Green Apartments, where Brown died, with 110 video cameras to watch and record police activity in the wake of the riots.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those cameras were meant to complement the 50 body cameras Ferguson officers were given by two private companies about two weeks after Brown’s death. Other departments in the region quickly approved thousands of dollars’ worth of wearable cameras as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are really enjoying them,” Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson &lt;a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-police-are-using-body-cameras/article_88e0067c-d3e6-5599-a581-a58d0022f1f8.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;i&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/i&gt;. “They are trying to get used to using them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the previous decade, the country’s biggest police departments were engaged in heated battles both in the courts and on the streets over the legality of videotaping cops. Cop-watch groups were deemed “&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/nyregion/RNC_intel_digests.html"&gt;extremists&lt;/a&gt;” in internal documents by the New York Police Department, and the American Civil Liberties Union &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/appeals-court-unanimously-affirms-right-videotape-police"&gt;went to court&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly to defend the right to record on-duty officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the battle has been turned on its head. Increasingly, police want cameras running. The cop-watch movement, designed at first to protect citizens from abusive patrolmen, has been found to also protect the cops themselves from bogus complaints from civilians—not unlike the &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/russia-dash-cam-videos-livejournal/"&gt;Russian dash cam culture&lt;/a&gt; that emerged to protect drivers from false insurance claims. Over 5,000 police departments around United States now have cop-camera programs, and similar programs are proliferating around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cops “ask, ‘Oh, how do you like Big Brother?’” Laurel, Va., officer Matt Jordan recently &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/police-body-cameras-spur-privacy-debate/2013/11/10/7e9ee504-2549-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;. “But I don’t have a problem with it. I like it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many full departments don’t yet require wearing cameras, some individual police officers around the country buy their own cameras to use on the job. The conversation has taken center stage in the police community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have worn one for years,” one anonymous officer, self-described as a member of the Los Angeles Police Department, &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2nyqk1/obama_calls_for_police_to_wear_body_cameras_as/cmibyun"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit, which has a &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/protectandserve/"&gt;substantial police community&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s proven the guilt of suspects 100 percent of the time and the D.A. loves it. Every complaint has been found baseless and made-up, or they were mad they got caught and thought making a complaint would help them. No police officer should go without wearing a camera.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Obama signed an executive order last week offering federal funding for 50,000 police cameras around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a week after Brown’s death in Ferguson, an Oakland cop was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9EYH72OMMI"&gt;cleared&lt;/a&gt; of accusations of racism because he wore a body camera that recorded the entirety of an incident in which he stopped, questioned, and ultimately released a man who had entered an unlocked fire department. (Within two minutes, the man produced identification showing he was a firefighter, and the police officer apologized and let him go.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The video footage allows the community to see the events as they occurred,” Oakland Police Chief Sean Whent &lt;a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2014/09/03/black-oakland-firefighter-says-white-cop-held-him-at-gunpoint/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement following the incident. “The officers clearly acted within policy. We continue to be committed to transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little doubt of the potential upside of on-body cameras. A year-long experiment by the Police Foundation showed that the use of body cameras “was associated with dramatic reductions in use-of-force and complaints against officers.” In Rialto, Calif., complaints against cops dropped by 88 percent and incidents of police force against civilians fell by 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With civilians and police officers joining the cop-watch movement, politicians are increasingly voicing their support as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/senator-wants-all-us-cops-to-wear-video-cameras/"&gt;has called&lt;/a&gt; for police to use video cameras if they want hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding. Missouri State Rep. Courtney Curtis &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-browns-death-ferguson-renews-calls-body-cameras-n182751"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that audio or video recording could have “[provided] the rest of the information” on exactly what happened before the shooting death of Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Hawthorne, Calif., Mayor Chris Brown said he &lt;a href="http://time.com/3137048/ferguson-body-worn-cameras-police-hawthorne/"&gt;supports&lt;/a&gt; cop cams because he is “simply not willing to gamble with a single life, or the wrongful accusation of upstanding officers.” In New York City, the country’s largest police force is &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/12/02/police-body-cameras-already-in-testing-phase-in-new-york-city/"&gt;already testing&lt;/a&gt; two types of cameras in some of the city’s most crime-heavy neighborhoods, and the city of Denver aims to equip all of its patrol and traffic officers with body cameras in 2015, at a cost of about $1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the national level, President Obama &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/obama-police-militarzation-plan/"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; an executive order last week offering federal funding for 50,000 police cameras around the country. The president’s plan calls for a three-year, $263 million spending package, around 29 percent of which would be used on the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Citizens should know officers are being held accountable,” Denver Police Chief Robert White &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26417279/denver-police-are-asking-800-body-cameras-officers"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Denver Post&lt;/i&gt;. “The only officers who would have a problem with body cameras are bad officers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of on-body cameras is that (ideally) both officers and civilians can be held accountable. Cameras can deliver a dose of objective reality where it’s badly needed, helping remove subjective hearsay from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you put a camera on a police officer, they tend to behave a little better, follow the rules a little better,” Rialto, Calif., Police Chief William Farrar &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/us/in-california-a-champion-for-police-cameras.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;told the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “And if a citizen knows the officer is wearing a camera, chances are the citizen will behave a little better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The path forward&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second night in a row, thousands of demonstrators took over Times Square in New York City on Thursday to protest against the killing of &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/eric-garner/"&gt;Eric Garner&lt;/a&gt;, an unarmed black man killed by “compression of neck” after a confrontation with a group of cops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protesters sat down in the streets and chanted “Black lives matter!”—until they were arrested by police on charges of disrupting vehicular traffic. As they were dragged off, a crowd of thousands cheered them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of on-body cameras is that (ideally) both officers and civil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to me, an incensed black man wondered aloud, “OK, we’re chanting, now what? What comes next?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Michael Brown case, there’s virtually no ambiguity surrounding Eric Garner’s death. A bystander took video of the entire incident, showing how cops jumped on Garner, shoving his chest, neck, and face to the ground. When he was gasping out pleas of “I can’t breathe” as his last words, his face was shoved harder into the concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grand jury last week declined to indict any police officer for Garner’s death. Now, activists are questioning &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/cop-cameras-garner-change/"&gt;what good police cameras do&lt;/a&gt; if nothing happens even when clear video evidence exists. At the subsequent protests, shaken demonstrators constantly questioned what real change they could effect in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular frustration felt in the streets of New York is easy to understand, but it might also be vastly underestimating the momentum the protesters themselves already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Garner never would have made global headlines if not for the fact that a camera recorded his death. The president wouldn’t have launched a federal investigation into the incident, the New York governor wouldn’t have promised reform, and the city’s mayor wouldn’t have said the event is “a call to action.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police brutality activists felt they lost another heartbreaking battle when a Staten Island grand jury said no criminal charges would be brought in the death of Eric Garner. But now their war is the center of the national conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cop cams aren’t perfect. There are major problems that have to be solved—including cost, privacy, what happens when officers themselves tamper with recording equipment, and many deeper issues within police culture—but the battle has shifted in fundamental ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More cameras can slowly but surely change the way Americans think about police and the momentum to put cams on cops is greater than ever.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just cop versus watcher anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Fear, loathing, and mass surveillance in London.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the morning of Thursday, Oct. 30, 2014, I set out to walk the perimeter of the London Congestion Charge Zone, a journey of some 12 miles around the center of the city. I began at King’s Cross, and walked widdershins, down the Euston Road towards Paddington. At its Western end, the Zone’s edge turns down Edgware Road, runs down Park Lane, Grosvenor Place, and Vauxhall Bridge Road, before changing course again across the river towards Elephant &amp;amp; Castle, Tower Bridge, Spitalfields, Shoreditch, and returns to Kings Cross once more by City Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/camera-map3.gif"&gt;&lt;img height="650" alt="camera-map3" width="650" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/camera-map3.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons that will become clear, I did not complete this walk within the day. I did however document the portion which I undertook—roughly half of the total—in the form of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/stml/sets/72157649048658422/"&gt;427 photos of surveillance cameras&lt;/a&gt;. I photographed every camera I saw that could see me (consider this a gross underestimation of the total).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Congestion Charge Zone covers the area enclosed by the Third London Wall. This Wall continues the transformation, begun by the Second, from a physical into an electromagnetic entity. It is made of bits, electrons, and radio waves, becoming less and less visible even as it becomes more pervasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/London_Wall_fragment.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="563" alt="London_Wall_fragment" width="750" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/London_Wall_fragment.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First London Wall was built in the late 2nd century by the Romans, in response to a political crisis. Following the murder of Pertinax in 193—the Year of the Five Emperors—the Empire split into civil war. Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain, allied with Septimius Severus, commander of the troops in Illyricum and Pannonia, but soon turned against him, proclaiming himself Emperor with the support of the legions in Britain and Hispania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance images attain the status of evidence for unknown crimes the moment they are created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Albinus narrowly escaped assassination by one of Severus’ messengers in 196, he put himself at the head of a 150,000-strong army and ordered the construction of fortifications around the city. Albinus did not last long: Sailing to Gaul, he met Severus’ army at Lugdunum (modern Lyon). In short order he was defeated and beheaded, his headless body tossed into the Rhine, and the head sent to Rome as a warning to other usurpers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15487154088_f249daac0d_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3888" alt="15487154088_f249daac0d_o" width="5184" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15487154088_f249daac0d_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Romans and their successors rebuilt and refortified the Wall for the next thousand years. Enclosing some 330 acres, the Wall forced all visitors to pass through seven narrow gates which connected the city to the Roman road system. Following the Blitz, the remaining fragments of the Wall were among the highest structures still standing in the City and can still be found extant at Barbican and Tower Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Second Wall was erected some 1800 years later on the orders of the City of London Police, following the bombing of the Baltic Exchange in 1992 and Bishopsgate in 1993. Rather than the Kentish ragstone that made up the First Wall, the Second Wall was built of sentry boxes and roadblocks, with access streets narrowed to chicanes to slow vehicles at designated choke points. (As with the redesign of Oxford Street following the Gordon Riots of 1780, and in contrast to Haussmann’s strategy in Paris, London pioneered the use of congestion as a tool of state control, which, if nothing else, is true to the sclerotic nature of the city itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15487722200_6074491b21_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3888" alt="15487722200_6074491b21_o" width="5184" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15487722200_6074491b21_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Second Wall, commonly known as the “ring of steel,” extended only slightly beyond the boundaries of the first, as the new loci of value, the towers of global finance, were broadly contiguous with older forms of wealth and power. In 2003, following the Sept. 11 attacks on New York City but preceding the July 2005 bombings on London itself, the police described the likelihood of a terrorist attack on the city as “inevitable” and widened the ring slightly, but ever since the 1996 bombing of Docklands, it had been both obvious and inevitable that a physically static Wall would not be sufficient. Instead, the wall must expand, and diffuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like its predecessor, the Second Wall still stands, but it has been entirely subsumed within the territory of the Third. Its sentry boxes are frequently left vacant, its gates left open. The only permanently operating components, its video cameras, form an inner processing ring reinforcing those of its successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/congestion-charge-zone-map.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3581" alt="congestion-charge-zone-map" width="4984" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/congestion-charge-zone-map.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo via &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/congestion-charge-zone-map.gif"&gt;Transport for London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Third London Wall—that which surrounds the Congestion Charge Zone—was completed in February 2003, and extended the traditional zone of the Wall from the financial district of the Square Mile to the West End, the commercial and entertainment district. In this manner it follows, predictably and admittedly somewhat belatedly, the expansion of capitalism itself into the realm of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspicion is a global variable. Once triggered it bubbles upward through the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core technology of the Third Wall, again pioneered but only partially implemented by the Second, is Automated Number Plate Recognition, or ANPR. Installations of over 800 ANPR cameras record the unique ID of every vehicle which enters the Zone in vast databases for later analysis. When the Wall was initially constructed, the public were informed that this data would only be held, and regularly purged, by Transport for London, which oversees traffic matters in the city. However, within less than five years, the Home Secretary gave the Metropolitan Police full access to this system, which allowed them to take a complete copy of the data produced by the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15053165623_67101ab6c6_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3888" alt="15053165623_67101ab6c6_o" width="5184" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15053165623_67101ab6c6_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This permission to access the data was granted to the police on the sole condition that they only used it when national security was under threat. But since the data was now in their possession, the police reclassified it as “crime” data and now use it for general policing matters, despite the wording of the original permission. As this data is not considered to be “personal data” within the definition of the law, the police are under no obligation to destroy it, and may retain their ongoing record of all vehicle movements within the city for as long as they desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I might be a terrorist who posed a threat to the good citizens of London—my own city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANPR cameras, which operate on, within, and beyond the boundaries of the Congestion Charge Zone, capture several pieces of data at once, in two forms. The first is raw information: the unique plate number of the vehicle tracked, the date and time of the tracking, and the location. The other two are images: a cropped image of the plate itself, for supporting the automated “read,” and a wider image of whole vehicle at the moment it is tracked, which may also include other vehicles, the roadway, the driver, passengers, and passers-by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15648793206_db20682400_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3888" alt="15648793206_db20682400_o" width="5184" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15648793206_db20682400_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gradual vacation of the human sentry boxes of the ring of steel, and their replacement with the automated eyes and minds of the ANPR system are mirrored, out of sight, by the replacement of rooms of watchers with databases, and of cartographers with LIDAR systems atop cars, and sensors aboard satellites in low Earth orbits. Watching robots, camera drones, these seeing systems operate continuously, beyond the range of human interest and endurance. And they operate, always, from above, giving them the privilege of surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law comes a distant second to the exercise of power itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveillance images are all “before” images, in the sense of “before and after.” The “after” might be anything: an earthquake, a riot, a protest, a war. Any system reliant on flows, which is all networks from vehicle traffic to commercial supply to video feeds to the internet itself, view disruptions within the same negative moral context. Surveillance images attain the status of evidence for unknown crimes the moment they are created and merely await the identification of the moment they were created for. Automated imagery criminalises its subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Stop-Search-500.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="375" alt="Stop-Search-500" width="500" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Stop-Search-500.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspicion is a global variable. Once triggered, it bubbles upward through the entire system. Walking down Park Lane, I was accosted by a man in a suit who demanded to know what I was doing. He took out his mobile phone, pointed it at my face, told me he was going to “circulate my description.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards, a colleague of his physically restrained me and called the police. Both men worked at the Grosvenor House Hotel, whose cameras were among those that had been trained on me as I walked, and so are included in my documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get in trouble for looking at the cameras, you stop looking at the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they arrived, the police officers explained that carrying a camera in the vicinity of Central London was grounds for suspicion. I might be a terrorist who posed a threat to the good citizens of London—my own city. Equally I might be casing the joint for some future crime, studying its defences in order to circumvent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying a camera thus justified the suspicion of the security guards who stopped me and performed a citizen’s arrest, detaining me until the arrival of the police. This suspicion in turn justified the actions of the police, who threatened me with arrest if I did not identify myself and explain my actions. For carrying a camera, I was told, I could be taken to the station and charged with “Going Equipped,” a provision of the 1968 Theft Act which determines the imprisonment for up to three years of anyone carrying equipment that may be used to commit a burglary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15053151703_965aea973b_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3888" alt="15053151703_965aea973b_o" width="5184" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15053151703_965aea973b_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the threats of the policemen were utterly baseless. Of course, the use of cameras in public, as dictated in numerous statements by the Metropolitan Police themselves, is not, and should not be construed as, a crime. But, as anyone who has ever encountered the police in an analogous situation knows, the law comes a distant second to the exercise of power itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fourth London Wall will be made of transponders carried in the vehicles themselves. Various forms of these are already on trial in the United States, where the E-ZPass system has migrated from toll bridges and tunnels and out into the wider city, where it can track the passage of vehicles with radio waves. The introduction of diagnostic data ports in cars has lead to the uptake of consumer monitors that also transmit location data, as do many common GPS systems. These systems will soon be formalised in the eCall platform, which will be mandatory in all new vehicles by the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuel. Withings. Fitbit. Healthkit. Little policemen in your pocket, little policemen on your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also being seen in the development and deployment of roving ANPR, fitted to every police vehicle and soon onto the bodies of council operatives themselves. Finally, the Wall loses all physical definition, becoming a truly ubiquitous zone, rather than a fixed barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15674078622_61e07bcf83_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3888" alt="15674078622_61e07bcf83_o" width="5184" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15674078622_61e07bcf83_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the intentionality of the camera’s image disappears into automation, and the Wall becomes ethereal and obscure, so the image itself dissolves, replaced by data. Cameras no longer see in pictures, but record and process information: the string of numbers on a car license plate, the dimensions of a human face, the IMEI of a mobile phone, the infrared reflectivity of plants, the depth and tonality of a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the time of the Fifth Wall, the system (which once contained actual human sensors, men with spears atop its ramparts), will regain the ability to see individuals. At first, this will be done through the medium of mobile phone tracking, which is also already present within the Zone. The swift shutdown by the City of London of the Renew “spy bins,” which tracked the movements of passers-by belies the widespread existing implementation of the system in shops and retail zones across the city, continually monitoring the movements of shoppers and passers-by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameras no longer see in pictures, but record and process information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, camera systems deployed at the airports in the outer reaches of the zone have already developed the ability to read human faces, irises, expressions and gaits in exactly the same manner as their ANPR predecessors, and build unique, storable profiles from them. While it’s always amusing to think of how such systems could be evaded through the use of masks or disruptive patterns, it should be noted that Section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, deployed across Central London on the night of Nov. 5, 2014, gives the police the right to define a zone in which anyone refusing to reveal their face may be imprisoned for up to a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15674039492_b8928329eb_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3888" alt="15674039492_b8928329eb_o" width="5184" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15674039492_b8928329eb_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Wall, and the Abstract Wall in its totality, is a model-mirror of social processes. As the Third Wall is the natural product of the expansion of financial systems and logics from the banking sector into every other, and the Fourth Wall addresses the mechanisation of the supply chain and the domination of logistics systems, so the Fifth goes hand in hand with the rapidly expanding privatisation of public space, the latest weapon being deployed against Londoners’ lingering desire for the freedoms of city life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished my walk at Vauxhall, as my detention on Park Lane had cost the better part of the early afternoon. I hope to complete the walk at a later date. The decision to stop was made, appropriately enough, in the shadow of Vauxhall Cross, the headquarters of the Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/nor/map/"&gt;The blazing red spot on the map&lt;/a&gt;, denoting a concentration of cameras, is accounted for by this—and by the far more mysterious building at 1 Bessborough Gardens on the other side of the river, blank-faced, festooned with cameras, whose neighbours regularly complain of electromagnetic interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any system reliant on flow views disruptions within the same negative moral context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For contrast, see the statistically unlikely dearth of cameras shown in the area south of the Grosvenor Park Hotel, on the lower half of Park Lane. Of course, there aren’t fewer cameras there. It’s a high-risk area—an area attractive to thieves, and terrorists. But when you’ve been physically restrained by blank men in suits, lectured and threatened by police officers, you really just want to get away from there as quickly as possible. When you get in trouble for looking at the cameras, you stop looking at the cameras. But you should really be looking at the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15673974802_ab5ac84225_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="3888" alt="15673974802_ab5ac84225_o" width="5184" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/15673974802_ab5ac84225_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the defining characteristics of the Wall is that it is not, and cannot be, voluntary. While some of the strategies listed here are based on cooperation with the Wall system (tachometers, navigation and check-in apps, fitness monitors, and wearable computers), these are always the accompaniment or introduction to mandatory systems, and are best seen as elective, collaborative trials rather than early adoption or individualistic disruption. Each successive Wall is only erected when the relevant technologies and social systems have arisen that no longer depend on consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Wall will be built from the things you wear on your body and arrange on the shelves in your bedroom. Nest, QOL, Hue. Automatic. Smart TVs. HAPIfork. Vessyl. Autographer. Memeto. Glass. Dropcam. Jawbone. Fuel. Withings. Fitbit. Healthkit. Little policemen in your pocket, little policemen on your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Wall will be made of intelligent dust which settles in the folds of your clothes and communicates your position and heart rate to orbiting satellites. London’s citizens will dream, and the images of their dreams will dance on the telescreens of Piccadilly Circus, and be found wanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/nor/2014/11/07/all-cameras-are-police-cameras/?curator=MediaREDEF"&gt;&lt;i&gt;essay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; is the first of a series of reports from &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/nor/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Nor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, an investigation into paranoia, electromagnetism, and infrastructure.

        <summary type="html">Setting up your own surveillance state has never been easier—or cheaper.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine if your government put a price tag on your privacy, acquiring shadowy surveillance technology that exploited your personal vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, journalists at the Ethiopian Satellite Television Service (ESAT) were sent something sketchy. The Amsterdam-based TV channel holds itself up as an alternative to the country’s tightly controlled state-run media and regularly runs programming critical of Ethiopia’s ruling regime. As such, the station’s broadcasts in the country are regularly jammed by government censors, and a recent documentary aired on state-run TV urged Ethiopians not to participate in ESAT’s programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first suspicious message arrived one afternoon via &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; to an ESAT employee in Belgium who was managing a company account. The message supposedly came from from Yalfalkenu Meches, a former contributor who had been out of contact for some time, and it included an attached file titled “An Article for ESAT” that raised a litany of red flags. It contained a veiled .exe file—the kind that triggers programs to start running on Windows machines and is the primary carrier of viruses—whose name included a long string of spaces designed to hide its true identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspecting that something was amiss, the employee refused to open the file, but Meches tried again—this time sending over a Microsoft Word document. Less than two hours later, Meches reached out to another ESAT employee, this one based in the company’s northern Virginia office, with a similar offer of an interesting article. Once again, Meches, or whoever had assumed his online identity, was rebuffed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESAT forwarded the emails to Citizen Lab, a multidisciplinary group at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs working on Internet freedom issues like censorship and surveillance, with a focus on the actions of repressive governments. Activists from around the world send files to Citizen Lab that they suspect contain viruses, and the group’s programmers will download them, rummage through the source code, and determine if there’s foul play involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen Lab &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/hacking-team-targeting-ethiopian-journalists/#24"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that one of the ESAT messages exploited a bug in Microsoft Word that would make the infected system covertly download a virus from a remote server as soon as it was opened. The virus was one of the tendrils of something called Remote Control System, which was developed by a Milan, Italy-based company called &lt;a href="http://www.hackingteam.it/"&gt;Hacking Team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/36090385?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacking Team is part of a new breed of companies that have sprouted up in the years since 9/11 sparked a global war on terror and a wired technological revolution. As the U.S. developed the online surveillance tools that, over a decade later, would eventually be revealed to the world by National Security Agency whistleblower &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/edward-snowden"&gt;Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt;, savvy businesses across the globe realized there were plenty of countries that might not be able to afford to develop such sophisticated technology in-house but still had money to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-party surveillance tools have grown from a virtually nonexistent industry in 2001 to one raking in over $5 billion annually. It’s also enabled countries around the world to cheaply establish a crude surveillance state, one that manipulates citizens and threatens their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen Lab knew that the operator of the Meches account was working for the Ethiopian government because Hacking Team only sells its products to governments. And Hacking Team wasn’t alone in giving the Ethiopian government precisely what it needed to spy on the people whose activities it didn’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The systems we are talking about are getting smaller, faster and cheaper every day.” —Marietje Schaake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year earlier, Citizen Lab came across a piece of malware circulating through the wilds of the Internet that hid itself behind pictures of Ethiopian opposition party Ginbot 7, which the government had designated a terrorist group. When researchers examined the virus, they discovered it was designed to send information to a server in Ethiopia that had been previously identified as being associated with a private surveillance software called FinFisher, made by company called Gamma International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This map shows all of the countries where Citizen Lab has identified servers running FinFisher. (Note: The presence of a FinFisher server in a country doesn’t necessarily mean that the government of that country is using the program; some of the servers listed here are undoubtedly acting as intermediaries to disguise the intercepted data’s ultimate endpoint.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/youonlyclicktwice-map.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="343" alt="FinFisher map" width="620" src="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/youonlyclicktwice-map-620x343.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication here is fascinating, noted Kenneth Page of the nonprofit Privacy International. Not only is the Ethiopian government outsourcing the construction of its surveillance technology, but it’s actively shopping around—using different programs made by different companies.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We couldn’t tell if it was a result of two different departments in the same government working independently or if it was just the government buying two different products to determine which one worked better,” said Page, whose group is part of the Coalition Against Unlawful Surveillance Exports (CAUSE), which advocates to control the flow of this type of surveillance technology. “Even within the industry itself, there’s a healthy competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a major demand for electronic surveillance equipment and a thriving ecosystem of companies from Canada from to Israel willing to sell off-the-shelf surveillance solutions to any government with a few hundred thousand dollars to spare. Since the market for these goods is both opaque and truly global, for groups like CAUSE, halting the flow of this technology is an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The balance between safety and privacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very good reasons why a government might legitimately depend on this type of surveillance software. On the most basic level, governments need to track terrorists and hardened criminals—two groups of people that, like pretty much everyone else, use the Internet to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of bad people in the world who are relying on these systems—telephones, mobile phones, Skype, &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/tor"&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, tablets, and computers—to do what they do, and that is a threat to all of us,” insisted Hacking Team spokesman Eric Rabe. “There is a real question here about the public’s need for privacy and our need for security. If we come down 100 percent on the side of privacy, which seems to be in vogue in tech right now, we are putting ourselves at very legitimate risk. And to ignore that is foolhardy. I think, by and large, we and the other people who are protecting this software are working to keep people safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabe insisted that Hacking Team goes to great lengths to ensure that the governments it sells to won’t use the products for ill, including an independent review process that exists outside of the company’s commissioned sales staff. Additionally, he noted, if a country were found to be using Hacking Team’s software to violate human rights, the company could stop sending over the updates necessary for its programs to bypass regularly updated commercial virus-detection software. Rabe declined to specifically state if this type of revocation has ever occurred. Even if it does happen, the programs would still be functional and effective to everyone who doesn’t has patched to the latest version of antivirus software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually stopping a company from selling this technology is far tougher than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Gamma did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for many Ethiopians, the government’s use of these surveillance technologies can be a matter of life and death. A &lt;a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/25/ethiopia-telecom-surveillance-chills-rights"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released by Human Rights Watch earlier this year detailed how widely electronic surveillance in the country was used to keep the government’s critics in check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded phone calls with family members and friends—particularly those with foreign phone numbers—are often played during abusive interrogations in which people who have been arbitrarily detained are accused of belonging to banned organizations. Mobile networks have been shut down during peaceful protests and protesters’ locations have been identified using information from their mobile phones.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former opposition party member told Human Rights Watch: “One day they arrested me and they showed me everything. They showed me a list of all my phone calls and they played a conversation I had with my brother. They arrested me because we talked about politics on the phone. It was the first phone I ever owned, and I thought I could finally talk freely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report noted that much of the technology used to monitor the country’s entire telecom network was provided by a Chinese firm called ZTE. But there are a litany of other options Ethiopian officials could have chosen from to meet their snooping needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/wikileaks"&gt;WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt; has been tracking the ecosystem of surveillance companies in a project called &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/"&gt;Spy Files&lt;/a&gt; since 2011. Spy Files hosts leaked documents from nearly 100 different companies in the surveillance technology business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the industry is so active, and demand for the products is so enormous, the likelihood that one of these companies will sell to autocratic regimes is high. South African firm VASTech was found to have sold a system to former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi that was &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://mg.co.za/article/2013-11-22-dti-funded-gaddafi-spyware"&gt;used to track and record&lt;/a&gt; every single phone call coming into and out of the country, a practice that allegedly amounted in over 30 million minutes of phone conversations every month. Not only did VASTech maintain a relationship with Libya for years, but the South African government approved hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of grants to the company, knowing full well that the funds would be going toward the production and sale of surveillance technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally produced software isn’t the only option available to a government looking for a virus that can infect a target and report back everything that person does online. If it wanted to, a government could employ the same tools cybercriminals around the world use to steal credit card information and hack personal email accounts every day. In fact, during Syria’s civil war, government affiliates used the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/9913/blackshades-rat-syria-xvisceral/"&gt;Blackshades Remote Access Tool (RAT)&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful cyberweapon developed in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-party surveillance tools have grown from a virtually nonexistent industry in 2001 to one raking in over $5 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, companies like Hacking Team and Gamma International provide a complete package with their specialty products. Customers can ring technical support if something goes wrong. The programs are designed to display data in a way that’s easily readable and specifically customized to meet that government’s needs. Most importantly, the software is constantly updated to avoid firewalls and antivirus programs because what’s untraceable today may be easily defended against tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament who has long advocated the implementation of strict international controls on the export of surveillance technology, argues that, even outside of the context of authoritarian regimes, the proliferation of these types of Orwellian technology is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think people have a legitimate reason to be concerned about the spread of intrusion and mass surveillance technologies on the broadest sense,” Schaake insisted. “This is very much a discussion we must also have in our own societies—for example, when it comes to the powers of intelligence services. The many cases of abuse indicate the massive impact they have on human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schaake has been interested in the issue since her first days in the European Parliament, when she saw how the Iranian government &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/03/how-nokia-helped-iran-persecute-and-arrest-dissidents/"&gt;used surveillance technology provided by Nokia Siemens Networks&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the communications of and track down dissidents during widespread public demonstrations that erupted following Iran’s disputed 2009 presidential election. The willingness of a well-respected European company like Nokia Siemens Network to help a repressive government like Iran crack down on its own people really struck a nerve.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These systems are used to intercept communications, access people’s devices, and track down dissidents,” she explained. “It demonstrates the devastating impact the unregulated trade in technologies can have on human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wassenaar Arrangement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually stopping a company from selling this technology is far tougher than it seems. For one thing, banning the sale of all surveillance software may ultimately do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you draw restrictions that are overly broad, you catch up technologies that have legitimate uses and harm the country’s business interests,” explained Danielle Kehl, a policy analyst at the New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute, which is also part of the CAUSE coalition. “It could have a negative impact on the free flow of information and severely hinder research.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the problem even more difficult is there’s little a single country can do on its own.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States, for example, has a complex set of export controls that require companies selling surveillance technologies abroad to first receive specific approval from the Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these controls in place, the system has been known to break down. In 2011, California-based surveillance tech firm Blue Coat admitted that 13 of its Internet filtering systems, which a spokesperson insisted the company had initially sold to Iraqi authorities, &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/blue-coat-syria-iran-spying-software/"&gt;ended up in the hands of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;, who used them as censorship mechanisms in the midst of the nation’s brutal civil war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, the international community has gotten together and started seriously addressing the global trade of surveillance equipment in an effort to ensure that these programs don’t fall into the wrong hands. The mechanism for doing that is called the &lt;a href="http://www.wassenaar.org/"&gt;Wassenaar Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a real question here about the public’s need for privacy and our need for security.” —Eric Rabe, Hacking Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years after the end of Cold War, world leaders met in a suburb of the Hague called Wassenaar and struck a deal to control the flow of conventional military technology. The agreement wasn’t binding like an official treaty; instead, it was more like a gentleman’s agreement by which each of the 41 participating nations agreed to do their best to subsequently ratify in their individual national legislatures whatever the diplomats in Wassenaar agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wassenaar has been in place since 1996, but it’s only been in the past two years that surveillance technologies have been added to the list. Updates to Wassenaar occur once a year; the 2014 plenary meeting was held last week, so the process is slow. Transferring those updates to individual member states is even slower—especially in the case of the European Union, whose process for adoption is positively glacial.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a comprehensive, international system of controls preventing companies in virtually every country from supplying surveillance technology to bad actors, it’s relatively easy for a firm that wants to sell surveillance technology to do so—or to simply set up a subsidiary in the next country over and sell to whomever it wants. Since the Wassenaar Arrangement only covers 41 out of the world’s 196 countries, finding a nation to set up shop in that lacks any kind of surveillance tech export controls likely isn’t all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem that advocates of stricter regulations like Schaake have with the way Wassenaar functions is that the controls, which give countries the ability to decide whether to grant specific export licenses, are enacted at the level of each individual government and aren’t necessarily consistent. That opens a window for companies to shop around. Just because one government denies a license, that doesn’t mean the company couldn’t just apply in another jurisdiction that’s more forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Europe has been slow in establishing a consistent set of export controls, at least one country has elected to take strong, unilateral action. Earlier this year, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel announced the country was placing a moratorium on the sale of all surveillance technology to a handful of nations it viewed as problematic—including &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/russian-blogger-law-vladimir-putin-censorship"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/tayyip-erdogan-against-the-internet/"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;—until a comprehensive solution is implemented by the E.U. as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a major demand for electronic surveillance equipment and a thriving ecosystem of companies willing to sell off-the-shelf surveillance solutions to any government with a few hundred thousand dollars to spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Supporters of Internet freedom are not supposed to deliver corresponding technology to the hands of such regimes which monitor Internet users and thus violate the most basic human rights,” Gabriel &lt;a href="http://www.dailysabah.com/economy/2014/05/21/germany-cuts-tech-export-to-turkey"&gt;told Turkish English-language newspaper the &lt;i&gt;Daily Sabah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, deciding precisely what qualifies a country as undeserving of surveillance technology is a tricky question in and of itself. It’s a simple decision not to allow an American company to sell malware to the government of North Korea, &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/sony-leak-north-korea-hack/"&gt;which seems to be doing pretty well on its own&lt;/a&gt;. The issue gets far thornier, however, when it comes to countries whose human rights records might not be stellar but aren’t quite bad enough to justify being ostracized by the international community.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Saudi Arabia, for example. The Saudi government has received considerable criticism for how it treats religious minorities and political dissidents; yet the country sat on the United Nations’ Human Rights Council as recently as 2012. In March, a group of 52 members of Congress wrote an open letter urging President Obama to advocate for reform during a then-upcoming meeting with Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, but the U.S. government recently sold the country &lt;a href="http://whitehouse.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/29/u-s-to-sell-f-15-fighter-jets-to-saudis-worth-30-billion/"&gt;$30 billion worth of F-15 fighter jets&lt;/a&gt;. In that context, making the argument that the U.S. should prohibit, or even significantly limit, the sale of surveillance equipment explicitly designed to catch terrorists to one of its prime strategic allies in the Middle East is a difficult one to make. As a result, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-karr/one-us-corporations-role-_b_815281.html"&gt;privately designed surveillance software&lt;/a&gt; designed by former-Boeing subsidiary Narus has been identified in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of speed is also huge. Right now, Wassenaar only covers a few types of surveillance technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Wassenaar added two more technologies to its export control list. The first type, called “Advanced Persistent Threat Software,” is essentially malware designed to circumvent the security features on a given device and then exact information from it. The category consists of viruses that log every button typed onto a computer keyboard and ones that use a phone’s GPS to record everywhere its owner travels. The second type includes systems that monitor telecommunications networks for the purposes of mass surveillance and intercepts information like emails, &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; searches, and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) calls via programs like Skype. The year before, the group started regulating tech that can be used to impersonate cell towers and allow governments to monitor communications using man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the only technologies even theoretically controlled across participating countries in a coordinated fashion. It leaves an enormous gap for other types of systems that haven’t yet been added to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Ethiopians, the government’s use of these surveillance technologies can be a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Page of human rights group Privacy International gives the example of a Dubai-based company called Advanced Middle East Systems, which sells a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebro"&gt;superhero-inspired&lt;/a&gt; product called Cerebro. It can be used to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/private-firms-mass-surveillance-technologies"&gt;tap into fiber-optic cables&lt;/a&gt; carrying Internet traffic and intercept all of the data being passed through without the need for the cooperation of the telecom company that owns the pipe.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/810492-8-advanced-middle-east-systems-brochure-cerebro.html#document/p1/a130449"&gt;Advanced Middle East Systems’ marketing materials&lt;/a&gt; state that the export of Cerebro is subject to the United Arab Emirates licensing controls. Page argues, however, that decision is left up to authorities in the U.A.E., and there’s nothing in Wassenaar that could stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wiretapper’s Ball&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any major industry, the companies in the business of selling surveillance technology have conferences. Those trade shows, which are held a few times a years in locations like Mexico and Dubai are called &lt;a href="http://www.issworldtraining.com/"&gt;ISS World&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly known as the “Wiretapper’s Ball.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS World gives everyone involved in the government surveillance business, from the vendors of surveillance technology to the government intelligence agents themselves, the chance to talk shop. The list of talks the conference held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, earlier this year include:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to intercept wireless communications on 3G, 4G and LTE networks mobile networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to carry out remote stealth surveillance on encrypted traffic networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use encryption to avoid remote stealth surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use facial recognition technology and gathering metadata on images posted on Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to defend your networks against zero-day attacks—meaning, ones exploiting previously unknown holes in digital security systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what public accounts do exist, the events themselves seem like profoundly weird experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bloomberg News &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-22/spies-fail-to-escape-spyware-in-5-billion-bazaar-for-cyber-arms.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; about an ISS World conference in Kuala Lumpur in 2011 noted that, unlike almost every other business conference in existence, there are no cocktail parties. Attendees try to avoid even being seen talking congregating with each other in public. That kind of socialization isn’t encouraged when the stated profession of nearly everyone in attendance is stealing secrets and the events are potential recruiting grounds for double agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a previous iteration of the conference in Prague, one telecom regulator from an African government looked up from his tablet to see the action being displayed on his monitor also being projected on a screen at the front of the room in real time. He had logged the hotel’s wireless Internet and someone had quickly hacked his system to teach him an important lesson about what happens when one is insufficiently paranoid in a room packed with spies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS World’s organizer, a Virginia-based company called TeleStrategies, is notoriously secretive. It doesn’t allow journalists into its conventions and, when contacted by the Kernel, a representative said the company has a policy of not granting interviews with the press.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software is constantly updated to avoid firewalls and antivirus programs because what’s untraceable today may be easily defended against tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the organization has apparently let in representatives from Sudan, Iran, and Syria—nations whose repressive governments have earned them a place on the list of countries sanctioned by the U.S. government. According to a &lt;a href="http://cda.io/notes/monitoring-the-lines/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by independent researcher Colin Anderson, TeleStratagies requires that attendees register under the umbrella of larger, pre-screened organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the case of Sudan, TeleStrategies has indicated knowledge of the participant’s nationality through its disclosed attendance records,” Anderson wrote. “Six of the listings are entities of the Government of Sudan, and three of which, recorded as ‘Governmental LEA,’ ‘Sudan Ministry of Interior,’ and ‘Sudan National Telecommunication Authority’, are directly cited within the State Department’s Human Rights Reports as parties in the country’s online and offline human rights abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their part, the conference’s organizers say they do what they can to block representatives from some of the world’s most notorious governments from attending. Other than that, as TeleStratagies President Jerry Lucas charges, ethical concerns are “not our responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a sentiment echoed by Hacking Team spokesman Eric Rabe. He insists that, outside of building and helping set up the technology, his company plays no part in whatever investigations its governmental customers decide to carry out. “I don’t think you want Hacking Team to be the universal arbiter of what countries are good and what countries are bad,” he noted. “That’s why we rely on blacklists; that’s why we rely on governments to help us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, that shirking of moral responsibility is a dodge. But in another, it’s hard logic to argue with. If governments don’t set up clear rules about the sale of these technologies, there’s going to be nothing stopping companies from selling whatever they want to the highest bidder—even if the intentions of that highest bidder are less than honorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The systems we are talking about are getting smaller, faster and cheaper every day,” Schaake told the Kernel. “Technologies that are sold as law enforcement tools can easily be abused in countries where the rule of law is not upheld, and where journalists, human rights defenders, opposition politicians, and ordinary citizens are attacked by their governments through these tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If government regulators and activists want to have any hope of ensuring Internet freedom for billions of people around the world, they’re going to have to act fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a seductive story, because it lets us off the hook. Obviously, the thinking goes, the deck (whichever deck you want to pick) is stacked against me, so no need to even imagine the failure that effort will bring. Better to just move along and lower my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

Regret seems to peak at 50, and then, as people start rationalizing that they're not expected to make much of a difference going forward, life satisfaction starts to increase. Of course, this is doubly backwards... we can (and must) contribute as we get older, and freedom is nothing to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/_/sethsblog/~sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/11/the-fear-of-freedom.html"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In October, Elon Musk delivered much the same message, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that “we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet efforts to develop artificial intelligence (AI) continue apace, with all the major (and even many minor) computer science research and development facilities devoting time, energy, and money to making computers behave like humans. Some of them are succeeding: Machines can now understand humans, speak with them, learn from them, and write like them. They will make some jobs obsolete and others easier. But they aren’t—yet—out to get us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Siri generation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mainstream consumer application of a machine that can comfortably interact with humans in something close to natural language came from Apple in the form of the Siri personal assistant. Since then, Microsoft has launched Cortana and Google also gave users the option to talk to their phones, albeit without an anthropomorphic personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Siri and its peers aren’t really AI. Though natural language processing—the ability for a machine to engage in conversation—has made great leaps in the past half decade, it remains limited, says Charles Ortiz, who works on AI at Nuance, the company responsible for Siri’s voice recognition technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can ask Siri to find restaurants in a particular neighborhood. But Siri cannot engage in more complex interactions that involve multiple data points, such as, “I’d like a reservation for a restaurant in Chelsea, preferably Italian but Chinese will do, for three people at around 7pm—oh, and I’d like one with valet parking and a children’s menu.” That sort of thing requires multiple interactions or several Google searches. “The real goal is to try to humanize this very expansive technological landscape that we’re all faced with everyday,” says Ortiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amelia goes to work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a machine that humans can casually chat with may be a while away, a more basic, text-based version for business is already live. IPsoft, a New York-based technology firm, has developed what it calls a “cognitive knowledge worker” named &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.ipsoft.com/what-we-do/amelia/"&gt;Amelia&lt;/a&gt;, and will work with Accenture to pilot the software with two big oil companies, Baker Hughes and Shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia’s anthropomorphic avatar is a pleasant, blonde woman with neat hair and a somewhat intense gaze. She (well, it) has the comprehension of a six-year-old and an emotional spectrum with which to react to the tone of her human interlocutor, says IPsoft’s Martijn Gribnau. If a human is becoming irritable, Amelia adjusts her tone accordingly. And if she can’t solve a problem, she calls in a human operator—and then watches and learns from that interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a human types a message to Amelia, the software breaks the message down into its component parts. As the conversation progresses, Amelia is able to relate prior questions to the current ones, informing her answers. While this may not sound like a particularly big deal for a six-year-old, it is an impressive feat for a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of its pilot, Baker Hughes initially will use Amelia to deal with outside vendors—queries about invoices and that sort of thing. At Shell, Amelia will help staff develop new courses for internal training, says Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personalized prose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Nuance and IPsoft want to understand natural language, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://yseop.com/"&gt;Yseop&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced easy-op), a French company with offices in the US, makes software that approaches natural language from the other side. Instead of trying to understand it, Yseop’s business is to write it. Other firms such as Narrative Science, whose robots &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://qz.com/133187/forget-organizing-the-worlds-information-this-company-wants-to-make-sense-of-it/"&gt;write for Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, and Automated Insights, which &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://qz.com/228218/the-aps-newest-business-reporter-is-an-algorithm/"&gt;works with the Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, make software that can generate reports from data. Yseop, however, is able to produce personalized reports and recommendations based on dynamic input from everyday users, says John Rauscher, the company’s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.vetonline.com/en"&gt;vetonline.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.kerastase-usa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-kerastase-us-Site/default/Yseop-Gender"&gt;L’Oreal&lt;/a&gt; use the software to ask customers questions and generate plain English suggestions for users in much the same way that a doctor or a hairstylist might. The software relies on an AI mechanism called an &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/287556/inference-engine"&gt;inference engine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauscher showed me demonstrations of other uses of the software, such as drawing up quick, easy-to-read summaries from a customer relationship management database. The underlying notion is that data is no longer hard to find or retain, but combing through mountains of information to interpret it can often be a challenging task for humans. If a machine can summarize lots of information in plain English, that makes it easier for humans to act upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Only the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia and Yseop’s software are rudimentary forms of artificial intelligence; neither is likely to be plotting world domination. A bigger worry is the more quotidian one of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call-center workers, whether dealing with invoice queries or offering advice on pet health, adhere to tight scripts and processes—individual staff are given limited autonomy, if any. Machines are well-suited to such roles. (Indeed, repetitive jobs have always been at risk from automation: In the 15th century, Venice installed a clocktower topped with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://img.qz.com/2014/12/d7fd4-moor_sm.jpg"&gt;two bronze figures&lt;/a&gt; that would strike a bell every hour.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in other knowledge-intensive professions, AI will augment, rather than replace humans, IPsoft’s Gribnau argues. Sales executives can get quick summaries about their clients rather than having to wade through spreadsheets. Doctors, lawyers, financial services workers, and others who need to be familiar with vast amounts of information can query assistants such as Amelia to easily pull up specific information about regulations, ailments, or past interactions. Emergency wards can automate triage for low-risk patients by using Yseop’s software to ask basic questions and spit out reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the benign, even desirable types of AI. Yseop’s software cannot think for itself; Amelia is not autonomous. Both need human input to be of any use. The terrifying “full” intelligence that Musk and Hawking worry about remains out of reach—for now. But in the meanwhile, perhaps AI can help humans avoid the equally scary prospects of having to chase invoices and stay on hold to call centers in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&amp;amp;blog=39587363&amp;amp;post=306575&amp;amp;subd=qzprod&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</content>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night in Miami, I found myself at a party. Rich and glamorous and beautiful people sipped top-shelf liquor by the swimming pool, expertly ignoring the black-tied waiters passing meticulously-assembled canapés. In that respect, the party was not unlike many, many other parties in Miami this week. But there was one thing that made this party different: it didn’t even &lt;em&gt;pretend&lt;/em&gt; to be about art. It wasn’t put on by a gallerist, or a private bank, or a luxury brand seeking to hijack some of the glamor of Art Basel Miami Beach. Instead, the party took place in Coconut Grove, far from the South Beach and Design District craziness, and it was connected not to any art fair but rather to the World Economic Forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this an Art Basel party, all the same? Yes, it was. Art Basel Miami is an orgy of luxurious excess, and it always has been — that’s it’s &lt;em&gt;raison d’être&lt;/em&gt;. The main fair itself, of course, is wildly profitable: galleries from around the world pay tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege of being able to stake out a few square meters of exhibition-hall space and hawk their wares to a crowd of ultra-wealthy art collectors, all of whom are pumped and primed to &lt;em&gt;buy buy buy, &lt;/em&gt;lest someone else buy the piece in question first.  But the main fair is merely the eye of a much, much larger storm. And it’s the storm, not the eye, that people talk about when they talk about Art Basel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm that is Art Basel takes place all across Miami, wherever excessive sums of money are to be found. And to understand what propels it forwards, it’s important to understand that the art, and the parties, aren’t the point. Artists, when they come to Miami for Art Basel, are invariably confused and/or angry. Sometimes, indeed, they get so angry that they’ll &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/arts/art-basel-miami-stretches-into-little-haiti.html?ref=arts&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;head-butt 700 water balloons&lt;/a&gt; while explaining that they’re “making a statement” because in &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; art space, “nothing’s for sale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this kind of thing makes artists feel better, because they find the shiny billionaire-friendly art with six- and seven-figure price tags at the convention center to be &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Art Basel looks just the same as the Armory Show; this year’s fair looks just the same as last year’s fair; what’s &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt;? What’s &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;? What &lt;em&gt;hasn’t even been made yet&lt;/em&gt;? (The most-read article at this year’s fair was &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/08/art-conversation"&gt;DT Max’s profile of Hans Ulrich Obrist&lt;/a&gt;, the curator who is “obsessed with the not-yet-done” and who is criticized as being “fast-moving and superficial”.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These art-world kvetchers, however, are making a category error. They think that Art Basel is about art, when in fact it’s about money, and — even more — about the people who have lots of it. At an art fair, paintings and sculptures stop being art — a fair is pretty much the worst possible environment in which to appreciate art — and instead become objects with a dollar value and an asking price and a future value trajectory. If you’re smart, you buy now, before the piece in question soars in value. If you’re stupid, you buy at the top, and find yourself saddled with an expensive work that no one wants. That’s the game, and in order for that game to be played the pieces &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; have a certain sameness to them, from one fair to the next and one year to the next. When the name of the game is brand recognition and speculation, the excitement comes from seeing artists rise and fall in value. This Anish Kapoor might look exactly the same as all the other Anish Kapoors you’ve seen at various art shows over the past few years, but when you know how much the asking price was, for each piece, at each show; when you can kick yourself for not buying when he was cheaper, or congratulate yourself on not buying when he was more expensive — &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you can start to understand what makes an art fair so exciting to the monied classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why an art fair is the perfect thing to have at the center of the Art Basel storm. It’s an orgy of capitalist excess, a place where objects with no intrinsic value sell for millions of dollars. Most crucially, it’s a place where sums which would be enormous in other contexts become commonplace, or even risibly small. When Art Basel started, its main backers were the real-estate developers throwing up identical white-steel-and-glass condominium towers in South Beach. The condo game, back then, was similar to the art game: buy now, for a million bucks or so; flip tomorrow for a healthy profit. And the best way to sell a condo in Miami Beach is to sell to a group of people who are surrounded by sun and sex and sand and who are simultaneously inured to eye-popping price tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miami real estate is much like high-end art in another important respect, too: it appeals to an international crowd of people who don’t necessarily like having their assets tracked and taxed by their domestic governments. You don’t hear the term “money laundering” very much inside the art fair, but there are obvious attractions to any asset which is both extremely valuable and highly portable. Then look at the sheer number of nationalities buying high-end Miami condos, invariably through shell companies, and remember that Florida has no state income tax. Let’s just say there’s a natural overlap there. And while the wattage of Miami does dim a little bit during the 51 weeks of the year that Art Basel is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going on, it’s also worth remembering that if you’re the kind of person who has eight different residences around the world, you might well only spend a week or two per year in Miami anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me back to that party in Coral Gables. The attendees were not Davos delegates: they weren’t billionaire industrialists, or heads of state, or economic policymakers. Instead, they were all in town for something called the World Economic Forum Family Business Community Next Generation Annual Meeting. Essentially, the WEF has realized that a rapidly increasing degree of economic power is being held in the hands of ultra-rich families, and so it has started catering directly to those families. Not just the men at the top who made the money in the first place, but to their children, too, and even, in some cases, their grandchildren. They’re &lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/05/17/eduardo-saverin-joins-the-stateless-billionaires/"&gt;the stateless rich&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s no coincidence that their annual meeting, this year, took place at the same time — and even in the same convention center! — as Art Basel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the storm that is Art Basel Miami Beach is, at heart, about creating a reason for the free-spending private-jet crowd to descend upon Miami for a week. The art attracts them, and so do the parties, and so do the celebrities, and so does the December sun. But mostly, Art Basel Miami Beach, and the orgiastic clusterfuck of conspicuous oneupmanship at which it excels, acts as a bat-signal for the obscenely wealthy. In a stateless world where everybody is always on the move, Art Basel is one of the few rocks in the stream — it’s the one week per year that you can put in your calendar, safe in the knowledge that all your gazillionaire peers are going to be there as well. That alone makes it almost worthwhile to buy a condo.&lt;/p&gt;

The experience is simply mind blowing and nearly impossible to put into words. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But once you try it, it's hard to disagree with Mark Zuckerberg that this is the next step in personal computing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/most-innovative-gadgets-2014-12#google-cardboard-is-another-take-on-virtual-reality-4"&gt;See the rest of the story at Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641537/s/4134134f/sc/15/mf.gif" border="0"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/a2.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/214612534600/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/4134134f/sc/15/a2t.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

        <published>2014-12-05T14:00:09Z</published>
        <updated>2014-12-05T14:00:09Z</updated>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Totally sweet and charming video of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak talking about the early days at the company while setting up and using an old Apple II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pJif4i9NRdI?rel=0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Apple's two founding Steves, Wozniak was the technologist and Jobs was the one with the artistic &amp;amp; design sense, right? But it's obvious from watching this video that Woz cared deeply about design and was a designer of the highest order. Those early Apple circuit boards are a thing of beauty, which is echoed in the precision and compactness with which Apple currently designs iPhone and Mac hardware. They each have their own unique way of expressing it, but Woz and Jony Ive speak in a similarly hallowed way about how their products are built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Wozniak still has improving the Apple II on his mind. &lt;a href="http://www.willegal.net/blog/?p=6023"&gt;From earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I awoke one night in Quito, Ecuador, this year and came up with a way to save a chip or two from the Apple II, and a trivial way to have the 2 grays of the Apple II be different (light gray and dark gray) but it's 38 years too late. It did give me a good smile, since I know how hard it is to improve on that design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <published>2014-12-05T14:23:33Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.themarysue.com/liv-ullmann-interview/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">At one point during our conversation, Liv Ullmann refers to herself as &amp;quot;one of the last wonders.&amp;quot; She's joking, but she's also right.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://static02.mediaite.com/themarysue/uploads/2014/12/liv.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="352" alt="liv" width="461" src="http://static02.mediaite.com/themarysue/uploads/2014/12/liv.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point during our conversation, Liv Ullmann refers to herself as “one of the last wonders.” She’s joking, but she’s also right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 75, the Norwegian &lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt; director has fifty year’s worth of renowned acting and directing credits to her name. Her colorful personal life and artistic achievements have made her a legend within her lifetime, and that’s fortunate for audiences—according to Ullmann, feminist filmmakers such as herself are now an endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context: Ullmann, regardless of how much she may equivocate over the word “feminism,” has a history of creating highly political art that challenges society’s mistreatment of women. In 1975, she made her New York theater debut starring as Nora in Henrik Ibsen’s &lt;em&gt;A Doll’s House&lt;/em&gt;, a Norwegian play criticizing the institution of marriage. (This was after her appearance as a very young actress in &lt;em&gt;Young Escape&lt;/em&gt;, a controversial play that &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/chicago-film-fest-liv-ullmann-739658"&gt;caused her family to disown her&lt;/a&gt;). In 1973, she starred in the Ingmar Bergman-directed Swedish TV show &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenes_from_a_Marriage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenes From A Marriage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which may have literally ended countless Scandinavian marriages—divorce rates nearly doubled the year the series aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Bergman—for most people familiar with Ullmann (Mary Sue readers are not most people, Hera be praised), Bergman is the first association that comes to mind at her mention, rather than Ullmann’s extensive work as a director and writer in her own right. Considering how iconic the story of Bergman and Ullmann’s partnership has become, it’s &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; understandable why her role as “muse” to a powerful man seems more significant to most cinephiles than her own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ullmann met director Ingmar Bergman when she was 25 and he was 46. The two quickly fell in love, and Bergman built a house for her and urged Ullmann to stay isolated with him on the island of Faro. She did, for years. In the early 1970s, Ullmann left the relationship and flew to Stockholm where, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/best/my-lover-the-camera"&gt;as the story goes&lt;/a&gt;, she was met in the airport by an army of actresses holding signs congratulating her on her “liberation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bergman and Ullmann continued their creative partnership even after their romance ended, and Ullmann is quick to admit that, as a woman, she might not have been allowed to direct if not for her former lover’s reputation. But she won’t allow critics to value her work solely through its association with Bergman, either. When &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.themarysue.com/http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/best/my-lover-the-camera"&gt;a viewer at an early screening of &lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt; responded to the film&lt;/a&gt; with, “I think Ingmar Bergman would be proud of that,” Ullman’s reply was quick and, judging from our discussion, totally typical. “Sorry, did Ingmar Bergman make this film?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mary Sue&lt;/strong&gt;: As a female director with a large body of highly-respected work, you are, unfortunately, a rarity. Can you talk about what it’s like to be an exception in that sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liv Ullmann:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, you see, I’m maybe not so much an exception, maybe because I’ve lived so long that more is coming, more is there. Because it is tough to be a woman. Also as an actor, but more so as a director. And even more today, when distributors and producers are looking at different kinds of films and maybe not necessarily what a woman would want to do. And then the age, you know. A man can be wiser and wiser, and a woman is older and older. And we need feminist voices today, you know. In my time, we had incredible feminist voices and I’m sure we have it today, too, but in all the massive outlets, maybe the one or two or three voices are somehow disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS:&lt;/strong&gt; Or they get shouted over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann:&lt;/strong&gt; They get shouted over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you consider yourself a feminist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, what is a feminist? I consider myself a realist who wants to stand up for women’s voices, not when they try to be the same, but when they stand up for who we are and what we see and how important it is that our voice is heard. Because yes, we are different. We are equal in every way but our voices are important to each other and our need to want to listen to each other and try to understand, because sometimes we are so difficult to understand. Men to understand us, and we to understand men. And we don’t. We don’t connect the way we should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS:&lt;/strong&gt; You see that in the movie a lot, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann:&lt;/strong&gt; You see that a lot in movies, and today you see it &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; in movies that are made, because I feel more movies are made towards groups than towards individuals, and they’re made more for mass media than for sitting in a movie house allowing it to happen. And I realize that we’ve come to a different way of showing movies. But I’m still with the old ways, and I can’t change. So I can’t expect people to decide that they will change with me, so I can see why I’m on the old side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS:&lt;/strong&gt; If I can repeat a quote back that you &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/chicago-film-fest-liv-ullmann-739658"&gt;said about Strindberg&lt;/a&gt; [August Strindberg, the playwright who originally penned &lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt; in 1888] that I thought was really interesting, you said, “He was not very good in his thoughts towards women, and that’s why it’s good a woman adapted it [&lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt;]. I wanted to remind him about something. He probably knew it but he didn’t want to face it.” What did you want to remind Strindberg?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann:&lt;/strong&gt; That we are equal human beings, and we were born with evil and anger and misunderstanding of what a man is, and so we are as needy and wanting to be part of him, as he, obviously, was needing and wanting to be part of us. And that’s why I’ve really taken the freedom, because it’s an adaptation, to give her a voice. And I gave him [Colin Farrell's character, John] a voice, too, at times, because he answers to her and she’s not always great at listening either. And in adaptations you are allowed. And I saw this movie, about Hawkings…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Theory of Everything&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! Which I loved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.themarysue.com/the-theory-of-everything/"&gt;Me too&lt;/a&gt;. It was so beautiful, I didn’t expect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann: &lt;/strong&gt;I didn’t expect it, either! I almost want to cry, “oh, my God, it’s good!” And that is the same, you know, you are listening and they’re so different, then you really hear the &lt;em&gt;woman’s&lt;/em&gt; voice and it’s from the &lt;em&gt;woman’s&lt;/em&gt; book! And you suddenly see him so differently, too! And I believe that’s a movie that people really will get and love and…oh, I forgot your question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS: &lt;/strong&gt;You answered it! I was curious about the adaptation. What drove you to adapt a Strindberg play that is often viewed as misogynistic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann: &lt;/strong&gt;Because he gave me the opportunity to have this incredible story, about the class system, about unfairness in life, but also this story about man and woman. What I wanted, because he gave me the freedom, to give her a voice that I missed a little in her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s thrilling to work on an adaptation with that kind of potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann: &lt;/strong&gt;Exactly. And I had the advantage, that I know Swedish. So I had the Swedish book and I had a lot of English translations, and German translations, and I did everything to make the best English translation I could. And then, there I went. “Oh! I think she’s thinking this, but I think she should &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; it!” And so on. It’s wonderful to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS: &lt;/strong&gt;One scene I was curious about that you added was the post-sex scene, where Julie is obviously in pain. Was that something that you had in your original draft of the adaptation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, I had…Strindberg doesn’t say…we know they “did it.” Was she a virgin? We don’t know. Was it the day of her menstrual thing? She’s touching her blood, and it can be both, and I wanted that to be there. I wanted the confrontation which is happening with a woman, whether it’s one thing or the other, that is there. The scares and uncertainty about who I am, and why am I alone on the bed, and why is nobody holding me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we know that, from the play, that he obviously was not doing that. And then we get to see him: “ahh! He’s washing himself! He’s washing her off his own body!” It’s the worst thing I ever heard. To wash yourself, of the most intimate thing, of being close to a woman. I wanted to show that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS: &lt;/strong&gt;All the acting is the best acting I think I’ve ever seen out of those actors. What was the casting process like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann: &lt;/strong&gt;Well it wasn’t difficult, because I asked them, and they said yes. And the only one I met before was Jessica, I met her in Los Angeles, and she is so incredible, and we had all these plans that she would have a scene with a bird, and she would try to make the bird do things, although the bird was in, like, a prison. But she knew. We learned that we couldn’t, because we had only two hours that we had to stick to, and I just thought “oh, she’s fantastic.” And she would quote things, and I was so impressed with her knowledge and literacy and so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Colin I talked to several times on the phone, and I said, remember, we have only twenty-five days of doing the movie, so you must know some of your text. I was a little un-feminist, I didn’t want to say [bossy voice] “learn your text!” But when he came, he knew all his text. All the actors knew all their text. And the same with Samantha [Morton], knew all her text. It’s the best they have done, they should all be shown, they should all be nominated, but I know it’s not going to happen, because people won’t see it. I wish someone would put into the marketing possibility for someone to see it, because they all deserve to be honored. But apart from that, you know, it will live long. Film is wonderful as opposed to theater, because it will always live there, and they will always be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you think that, in general, films like &lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt; are a dying breed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullmann: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, unfortunately. And that is sad, because we need these. Like we need books, we need classical music, we need ballet, we need opera, to remind us really of who we are and why we are, and we need in movie houses—even to be in a movie—where you sit and see not only excitement and man-hero, woman-hero, you need quietly, just like that Hawking movie we talked about, to know how people overcome. Or maybe don’t overcome. Know why we say “I’m feminist,” but we don’t really know. Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I am one of the last wonders in this thing, and I wish it wasn’t so. Although I have to say that this year I’ve seen incredible movies, so I believe in my lifetime, it will still exist. But I don’t know how long it will exist, because it has to do with “what do you marketing people want to do, what do you distributors want to buy.” Is the risk so big that it’s difficult to do? And producers, where do you want to give your money? And we don’t cost a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, what I want to stress—and I haven’t said this to everyone, I forgot!—it’s a&lt;em&gt; film&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not digital. It’s a film. And there is a difference between film and digital. Because digital, you know, it’s perfect and whatever. But with film, you get depth. You get subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt; opens today in theaters. Look for The Mary Sue's review later tonight!]&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Two Ohio police officers were suspended this week after racist texts allegedly exchanged between the two men were made public.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="ohio cops" height="210" alt="" width="320" src="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ohio-cops.jpg"&gt;Two Ohio police officers were suspended this week after racist texts allegedly exchanged between the two men were made public. Captain &lt;strong&gt;Thomas Flanders&lt;/strong&gt; and Detective &lt;strong&gt;Michael Sollenberger&lt;/strong&gt; are on paid leave amid an investigation into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dayton chapter of the NAACP obtained the text messages a few months ago, and they contain some pretty disturbing sentiments. For example, one of the texts reads, “What do apples and black people have in common? They both hang from trees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reference to “coons,” as well as at least two mentions of the n-word. In one exchange, one of the men texted, “I hate n***ers. That is all.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Commonly known as an electronics company, Fujitsu's Akisai project could have a big impact on agriculture in Japan as well as overseas.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was previously published by our friends at &lt;a href="http://ignition.co/"&gt;Ignition&lt;/a&gt;. It has been modified from the original.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img height="482" alt="Regular rice and sake rice" width="720" src="https://www-techinasia.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sake1-720x482.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular rice (left) and sake rice (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Japanese cuisine was &lt;a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/10/23/national/unesco-to-recognize-japanese-food-culture/"&gt;officially recognized as a world cultural heritage&lt;/a&gt; and its fan base continues to grow every year. Riding on the same trend, interest in Japanese alcoholic beverages has also been on the rise with &lt;em&gt;sake&lt;/em&gt; (rice wine, pronounced “sah-keh”) being one of the most popular choices. However, for brewers this sudden increased interest presents a rather difficult problem – there isn’t enough sake rice to meet current demand. To solve this dilemma, Dassai Sake maker Asahi Shuzo teamed up with IT and electronics firm Fujitsu to find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img height="952" alt="Dassai, pictured, is one of Japan’s top sellers" width="720" src="https://www-techinasia.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sake2-720x952.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dassai, is one of Japan’s top sellers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asahi Shuzo lends a helping hand to sake rice growers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asahi Shuzo is a brewery based in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. Their Dassai Sake brand is proving to be a hit both domestically and internationally, surpassing sales figures from a decade ago by tenfold. To keep up this momentum, they need plenty of rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rice we eat and the rice used for sake are two completely different kinds. The most widely used variety of sake rice in the industry is Yamada Nishiki. Used and loved by many brewers, including Asahi Shuzo, the grain was developed in 1936 in an agricultural testing center from Hyogo prefecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, growing taller than its edible cousin means it’s also much more easily affected by the continuous barrage of typhoons that hit Japan during autumn, making it comparatively harder to cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img height="405" alt="sake3" width="720" src="https://www-techinasia.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sake3-720x405.png"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sake exports are rising but rice supply is not&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asahi Shuzo, looking to meet demand, wanted to increase the number of Yamada Nishiki farmers. As their supply comes from contracted farmers, increasing the number of contracts would result in an increased supply of sake rice. Although simple in principle, agricultural workers are aging and dwindling so most existing farmers are reluctant to take on the challenge of growing a new crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with this problem, Asahi Shuzo teamed up with Fujitsu to launch &lt;a href="http://jp.fujitsu.com/solutions/cloud/agri/"&gt;Akisai&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. The service acts as a form of information crowdsourcing. It collates useful information regarding farmland and farming techniques which can be applied to various aspects of any given farming business. Its versatility notwithstanding, Asahi Shuzo has plans to utilize the service specifically to increase Yamada Nishiki rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kouji Watanabe, who works on Akisai, gave us his thoughts on the service. “Professor Sakurai [Asahi Shuzo CEO], is really enthusiastic about the service. He’s proud of his Dassai Sake but at the same time, doesn’t want it to turn into a ‘mythical sake’ that nobody can get their hands on. I would say he’s a pioneering individual in that he uses data in producing the sake rather than appointing a traditional master brewer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From field data to cultivation know how&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asahi Shuzo and Fujitsu have one goal when it comes to Yamada Nishiki – to accumulate data and translate it into cultivation know-how. Their journey started in April 2014 when they began collecting data from two Yamada Nishiki farmers based in Yamaguchi prefecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they needed to understand the environmental conditions of the rice paddies. This includes ambient temperature, humidity, ground temperature, ground moisture and ground electro conductivity. These are all measured in hourly intervals using a small solar powered sensor placed in the paddy and the data is then transmitted via built-in antennas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other type of data being collected is the actual farming technique used. This involves recording the time, place, and technique employed as well as logging fertilizer and pesticides amounts. At the same time, the yield, quality and growth status of the crop is also recorded. All the data is put into Akisai using a simple interface via a computer, tablet or smartphone. “From there, we’ll process the data into actual cultivation know-how,” explains Watanabe. “And in doing so, the next generation of farmers and newcomers will be able to see the best cultivating conditions. Even the farmers who helped us in obtaining this initial data were keen on the idea of being able to leave this kind of information for their future successors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fujitsu doesn’t want to stop there, though. In time, they plan on producing entire region specific cultivation guides so farmers can produce consistent yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See: &lt;a href="https://www.techinasia.com/hailo-crashing-taxi-app-find-life-japan/"&gt;I can see your Hailo. After crashing out of US, can taxi app find new life in Japan?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Akisai isn’t just for rice farmers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project only commenced six months ago, so it’s still very much in its infancy. Even so, it’s caught the attention of a multitude of companies and organizations. “By making the data openly available, it’s made more people interested in viewing it. Institutions, testing labs, universities and fertilizer makers are all keen on analyzing and interpreting the data in various ways to suit their respective needs,” Watanabe says, adding that Fujitsu’s system differs in that they have actual field data as opposed to data obtained from controlled research conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akisai’s reach extends to more than just rice farming though and already has 300 members from various backgrounds. As a complete agricultural system, the collected data can lend itself towards various aspects of the industry such as business management, finance, genetically modified produce, and sales. The accumulated data can even be used to help manage and breed livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their ongoing development, Fujitsu plans on further expanding Akisai for overseas markets. “We already have members [who deal with livestock] from countries such as Korea, Australia, Poland and Turkey. Whilst the cultivation and farming portion of the project is still in its early phases, we’ve been considering reaching out to indoor agricultural facilities in Vietnam,” Watanabe notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asahi Shuzo is also taking this early success and accelerating its international expansion. In 2015, it plans to open a store in Paris and introduce its sake to new customers.&lt;/p&gt;

As we noted earlier today, the on-demand transportation startup launched operations in Portland this afternoon, despite not having the permits and inspections required by the city for a taxi service. The city has already conducted “enforcement action” against Uber drivers and is certainly not happy with Uber doing business on its streets. “We have told Uber and Lyft that they are welcome to offer ideas … &lt;a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/qa-heres-uber-launched-portland-despite-illegal/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_term=Read%20More&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+geekwire+%28GeekWire%29"&gt;Read More on GeekWire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/geekwire/~4/buYy9ustzMc"&gt;</summary>

Our rankings are based on a variety of factors including design, software and hardware features, content selection, carrier availability, and price. We only consider phones that are available in the U.S. at the time of publication. We list approximate prices for what phones cost without a contract. Prices vary from carrier to carrier and retailer to retailer. &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/best-smartphones-2014-11"&gt;You can see November's smartphone rankings here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;#17 BlackBerry Passport&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt="" src="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5453b1356bb3f7645cc6247a-400-300/17-blackberry-passport.jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry's newest smartphone is the square-shaped BlackBerry Passport.

        <summary type="html">&lt;img height="382" alt="diabetes" width="595" src="http://d1435t697bgi2o.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/diabetes-595x382.jpg"&gt;Type 1 diabetes is physically taxing and its maintenance exhausting, but I've learned to live with my self-afflicting body.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;img height="382" alt="diabetes" width="595" src="http://d1435t697bgi2o.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/diabetes-595x382.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MegaBus from Washington, D.C., to New York was cold and uncomfortable, but for three hours I slept uninterrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long interstate nap that evening was a welcome coda to the nightly sleeplessness I’d endured for the previous three weeks of my sophomore year of college. Those nights, as midnight passed into early morning, I would hop out of my girlfriend’s dorm-room twin, and writhe and wince until the searing cramps in one of my feet subsided. Often, no more than a half hour later, just after settling back to sleep, I would have to dash from the room to the bathroom next door to avoid wetting the bed. Most nights I barely slept, simply dozing during miserably short intermissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in New York, on the Upper West Side, my mother greeted me at the door of our family’s apartment. “You look thin,” she said. I was. Pictures of me from that February show a gaunt, almost skeletal figure, wearing a forced smile and mismatched Old Navy blues. That winter evening I returned to New York, I stepped on the scale in my parents’ bedroom. It read 165, 25 pounds lighter than I was three weeks earlier. My mother fretted and I tried to convince her the cause was an unduly stressful second semester. But even I knew the heaviest course load couldn’t trigger such dramatic change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Regular” things like biking or a few drinks—which for me, taken to excess, is a direct path to a coma—offer a few dangerous moments of release. We all have our vices; mine is hypoglycemia. Those “regular” things give me a few moments of freedom.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning my parents and I took a crosstown cab to the pediatric emergency room of a New York University hospital. The nurse led me to a private room, where a James Bond movie likely older than most of the ward’s patients was inexplicably playing on a TV in the corner. A few blood tests and 15 minutes later, the nurses and a doctor returned. My blood glucose level, they said, was 700 mg/dL—milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood. Before meals, a normal, healthy measurement should have read somewhere around 100. The diagnosis: diabetic ketoacidosis; Type 1 diabetes, at its extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS A DESCRIPTIVE CATEGORY&lt;/strong&gt;, Type 1 diabetes is a relatively new condition. The medical community did not achieve consensus around the disease’s name until the mid-1980s, after three decades of peer-reviewed debate about its origins, causes, and treatment. Before “Type 1” became widespread, researchers referred to the “insulin-deficient” category of diabetes as “juvenile,” an epithet that describes the general age of their clinical subjects. Type 2 patients, who are “insulin-insensitive”—their bodies produce insulin, but process it poorly—are mostly older than those with Type 1. Empirically, “juvenile” was a mostly accurate qualifier: without synthesized insulin, a high percentage of young people afflicted with the disease did not reach adulthood. Ketoacidosis, which releases hormones that intercept the processed sugars the body’s insulin might otherwise provide, killed those doctors’ young patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is an autoimmune disease, and by some fluke of genetic design, I was born more likely to acquire the disease than the average human. My susceptibility meant that a bad infection I got that February triggered the disease’s onset. I had been prone to infections since early adolescence, when my middle-school pimples would metastasize and swell into large, unruly cysts. In the weeks that preceded my diagnosis, my body had become peppered with new cysts, larger than before, which would appear and rupture in quick succession. My knuckles grew scabbed and scaly, as if I had pummeled a leather boxing-bag with my bare hands. My mouth dried out; in class, my voice would slow to a slur before disappearing altogether. I began to experience the nightly cramps and insistent urination. My body could not absorb the foods I gave it, and so it turned to itself for meager sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the diagnosis, I spent three days in the hospital’s intensive care unit, where I learned to live in a new, self-afflicting body. My doctors gave me technologies to manage the symptoms of the disease. A full roster of specialists introduced the practice of diabetes “maintenance,” as if my insulin-deficient body were a faulty elevator struggling to meet its inspector’s code. Theirs was a vocabulary of precision. From the educator, I received a glucose meter, to track shifting blood glucose levels. The nutritionist advised that I keep a food journal, a self-help guide that guards against gummy peach rings and Arizona iced-tea lemonade, among other occasional dietary slip-ups. The endocrinologist, my care roster’s captain, assigned me a regimented suite of insulin supplements, which together adjust my blood glucose to a normal level. And there were extras: ketone sticks, to anticipate the return of ketoacidosis, and a glucagon pen, in case my glucose levels drop too low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This arsenal is intended to make my diabetes a disease of adulthood, even old age. Had I been diagnosed before the discovery of insulin, in the early 1920s, my doctors would have characterized my disease as a state of fragile dependence, often sustained by a diet of starvation. With the invention of synthesized insulin in 1978, the technology of diabetes medicine has become straightforward. I can track my glucose levels and moderate my insulin dose with precision, all from a small carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my arsenal, my doctors suggest, I am prepared for all unknowns. If my glucose levels rise too high, I can correct them. If they drop, I can fix that as well. I can now be “normal,” or as normal as anyone lacking a functioning bodily organ can be. The uselessness of my pancreas is the most direct consequence of my disease, but diabetes’ constant reality is much more than a matter of malfunctioning bodily organs. My glucose meter calculates the relative damage of the disease: if it reads 103 mg/dL, I have consumed enough insulin; 236, too little; 65, too much. I’ve found that each number corresponds, roughly, to an emotion:  At 103, I am calm; at 65, I stagger and stumble; at 236, my high glucose levels overwhelm my body and the simple act of standing up becomes intolerable. There are times when my disease may be more accurately described as a disorder, in the way it wreaks mental havoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I covet my glucose meter for more than its technical measurements. If my emotion wavers, I rush to the meter to justify my momentary dysfunction, hoping, by some weird logic, for an irregularly high result. The tip of my left ring finger, from which I compulsively draw my meter’s blood samples, bears a constellation of maroon-colored scars, many fresh. Some days, I puncture this spot 10, 15 times: before breakfast, after breakfast, after lunch, after-after lunch, after-after-after-lunch for good measure. Whatever emotional relief my meter brings is always short-lived. But I return to the meter hourly, half-hourly, to confirm that my glucose levels are where they should be, and that my emotions make sense. My disease is physically taxing and its maintenance exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My compulsive maintenance keeps most of the disease’s worst afflictions in check. But the difference between “normal” and “dangerously sick” can be a small mistake. One week during my senior year of college, my endocrinologist accidentally bungled an insulin prescription submitted to the local pharmacy. The pharmacist filled the original prescription on a Friday; the endocrinologist would not be able to correct her mistake until Monday. The intervening weekend was a mess of anxiety, as my glucose levels crept higher with every meal. Fortunately, I retrieved my insulin before ketoacidosis returned. But the trademarks of gradual depletion returned—exhaustion and a heavy, cluttered mind, along with the fear that my glucose levels would continue to climb unabated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology of diabetes maintenance reiterates the vulnerability of my diabetic body, and the ways in which I am not always my own best keeper. My most frequent mishaps are minor human errors: a lost insulin pen or a dwindling supply of glucose meter test strips. My collection of life-saving medicine is now distributed between several backpacks and a portable case, multiple cities, and the turned-out pockets of my recently washed jeans. Once I discovered a half-used insulin pen in the pocket of an old winter coat. But these human errors are not surprising or uncommon: Type 1 is a human disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I covet my glucose meter for more than its technical measurements. If my emotion wavers, I rush to the meter to justify my momentary dysfunction, hoping, by some weird logic, for an irregularly high result.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all my potential human errors, low glucose levels are the most dangerous. Ketoacidosis kills slowly, but the damage of hypoglycemia is immediate. Below 70 dg/mL, my body is running on fumes; life becomes a gathering collection of near-death experiences. But while high blood glucose dulls my thoughts, hypoglycemia is a sensory spectacle; the dimmest light glimmers in Technicolor, like a distant horizon in Oz. These bouts of low blood glucose are also the closest imitation of the “normal” life my doctors promise. My dietary constraints briefly disappear, and the burden of maintenance gives way to a playful euphoria. These moments can be as spectacular as they can be lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the gravity of hypoglycemia, it is logical to think that I would meticulously monitor my glucose levels during a long bike ride, or lock up my booze. Instead, I find myself sneaking an extra unit of insulin before dinner, to prompt that quick high two hours later. “Regular” things like biking or a few drinks—which for me, taken to excess, is a direct path to a coma—offer a few dangerous moments of release. We all have our vices; mine is hypoglycemia. Those “regular” things give me a few moments of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other technological advances that are meant to lessen my mental burden of maintenance and to make “normal” a more constant feature of my diabetic life. When I was diagnosed, my doctors offered me “the pump,” the next technological stage of diabetes treatment. Part electronic monitor, part portable insulin catheter, the pump allows its wearer independence from the ritual of manual injections. The pump would mimic but not replicate my negligent pancreas, injecting a finite and continuous supply of insulin into my bloodstream. But three years in, my endocrinologist no longer raises the topic. My glucose checks and insulin shots are chaotic and unreliable, but they have become routine. Even if the solace of my routine is imagined, the rush to my blood glucose meter is a distraction from the physical dysfunctions caused by my pancreas. The pump is healthier, my doctors insist, the regular insulin injections better mimic the functions of a normal, non-diabetic body. But I fear the new routine of an unfamiliar technology, the abandonment of my imprecise, imperfect maintenance of my disease. There is comfort in habit and ritual, and in the human connection, no matter their faults.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rising importance of data to companies (organizations in general and marketing departments in particular) is changing the perception of marketing's value. In fact, marketing is now so important that CMOs will make the best next-generation CEOs—thanks to their understanding of data and the customer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img height="494" alt="" width="332" src="http://ct.adweek.com/files/big-data-cover_0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Meet Dan Siroker, a new kind of marketer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As the Obama campaign's director of analytics in 2008, one of Siroker's key responsibilities was optimizing the campaign's website, a critical fundraising tool. Using sophisticated A/B testing, which involved comparing the results of 24 combinations of visuals, copy and calls-to-action, Siroker and his team identified the most effective combination for raising campaign funds from Obama supporters. Not only did this winning combination raise an extra $60 million for the campaign, as &lt;a target="blank" href="http://blog.optimizely.com/2010/11/29/how-obama-raised-60-million-by-running-a-simple-experiment/"&gt;Siroker explained in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, but the A/B testing also generated the data to prove it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Marketing teams have historically found it hard to be considered a revenue center vs. a cost center. But when you generate $60 million—and show exactly how you did it—there's no longer any doubt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Now the CEO and co-founder of Optimizely, Siroker is just one of many pioneering, data-driven marketing executives who have become CEOs. Former marketing executive Paul Pellman was the CEO of Adometry before it was bought by Google earlier this year. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/8/14/why_more_marketers.html"&gt;Audi, Royal Dutch Shell, and Gilt Groupe have all recently named former marketing executives to CEO roles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Here's why this is a big deal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Only the marketing department has a clear window on the behavior of the prospect during 90 percent of the buyer's decision making—the time spent doing research via visits to websites, reading online reviews, connecting with peers on social media and conducting online searches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With the data created by this online behavior, marketers possess tremendous insight into their companies' potential customers. &amp;quot;When I tell people that we can know, in real time, every single visitor when they arrive on our site and know what company type they are from and that we can target specific titles or regions or individual companies, they're blown away,&amp;quot; says Bill Macaitis, former CMO of Zendesk, describing the company's ability to understand their prospects in real time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Marketing now holds the key to sales commissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Marketing's possession of this insight into the customer represents a huge shift from the past when the sales department played a much larger role in shepherding the prospect through the sales process. But now, the sales department has little direct knowledge of 90 percent of the buyer's journey. It is now the marketing department, using data gleaned from the digital footprints left by prospects, that has the insight into this major portion of the sales process. And marketing can supply salespeople with exactly what they need: the qualified leads that are their lifeblood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So data brings marketing and sales together. And because data can also identify deals that were marketing-sourced, the finance team also gains a new respect for marketing and its contribution to revenue. And finally, these changes have brought marketing closer together with the IT department, which helps install the marketing automation software, analytics tools and dashboards it needs to read the digital body language of customers and prospects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Marketing is now at the nexus of business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The CMO's team has the clearest window into customer and prospect behavior. To sales, the CMO delivers the leads most likely to buy to sales. To finance, the CMO shows his or her team's revenue contribution. And with IT, the CMO helps built out the marketing technology stack that mediates critical interactions with customers and prospects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The winning companies of the future will be data-driven and customer-focused. No one is in a better position to lead this kind of company than the CMO—the executive who is eminently qualified to be your next CEO.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Russell Glass is co-author of &lt;strong&gt;The Big-Data Driven Business: How to Use Big Data to Win Customers, Beat Competitors, and Boost Profits&lt;/strong&gt;, and Head of B2B Product, LinkedIn.  A serial technology entrepreneur, Glass was formerly CEO of Bizo, the marketing platform recently acquired by LinkedIn. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641572/s/412f3630/sc/24/mf.gif" border="0"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612475904/u/49/f/641572/c/34792/s/412f3630/sc/24/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612475904/u/49/f/641572/c/34792/s/412f3630/sc/24/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612475904/u/49/f/641572/c/34792/s/412f3630/sc/24/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612475904/u/49/f/641572/c/34792/s/412f3630/sc/24/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612475904/u/49/f/641572/c/34792/s/412f3630/sc/24/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612475904/u/49/f/641572/c/34792/s/412f3630/sc/24/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This is a new way of looking at corporate citizenship, from occasional philanthropic and cause-oriented actions that lie outside of their core business, to the core business itself and its potential to make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these represent a transient, perhaps insincere, and unsustainable role for brands in making the world better, whereas aligning how the actual products and services can make a positive impact makes them enduring and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, today's greatest and most enduring brands came into the world through a shared-value idea. The world's most-loved brands started with a single person who saw a societal need and looked to create something that could address that need and make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The recent Hello Kitty Con–a massive gathering of the immortal Sanrio character’s biggest fans—only marked the beginnings of the pop culture icon’s celebration in Los Angeles. For another five months, until April 26, 2015, the city’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.janm.org/"&gt;Japanese American National Museum&lt;/a&gt; hosts a pilgrimage-worthy exhibition: &lt;em&gt;Hello! Exploring the Supercute World of Hello Kitty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/janmhellokitty.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="JANMHelloKitty" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/janmhellokitty.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibit doesn’t do much to quell that &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-hello-kitty-in-los-angeles-not-a-cat-20140826-column.html#page=1"&gt;confusion over Hello Kitty’s species that lit up the internet this past summer&lt;/a&gt;. See this wall text that maddeningly refers to her as a “girl,” even though &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://kotaku.com/dont-be-silly-hello-kitty-is-a-cat-1627820750"&gt;officials clarified to Kotaku she was, indeed, a cat (more or less)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittywallart.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittycelebs.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="747" alt="hellokittycelebs" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittycelebs.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=747"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it does accomplish, though, is to deftly turn a bunch of consumer products into a kind of sociological study that traces societal shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, for example, this vignette about Sanrio’s insistence on making paper products for handwritten communication in a digital age:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittystationery.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="hellokittystationery" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittystationery.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, for another, this room that traces celebrities’ obsession with Hello Kitty, but also our obsession with celebrities and their possessions, full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/celebrityhellokittypurses.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="celebrityhellokittypurses" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/celebrityhellokittypurses.jpg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A room featuring contemporary artists’ takes on Hello Kitty includes all kinds of philosophical statements for you to tease out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/contemporaryhellokittyart.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="contemporaryhellokittyart" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/contemporaryhellokittyart.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of the exhibit are arranged thematically, and the whole thing moves somewhat roughly chronologically. About halfway though, for instance, we reach the part where Hello Kitty reclaimed her cultural identity—the point at which Sanrio started nodding at its Japanese roots, rather than always aiming for country-less appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/traditionaljapancabinet.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="traditionaljapancabinet" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/traditionaljapancabinet.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittysushistuff.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="hellokittysushistuff" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittysushistuff.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unsurprising, though, that an exhibit about a cartoon character that’s existed longer than most of us reading this will also get you right in the feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s the fact that if you were ever a Sanrio fan, you’ll spend a lot of time wandering through the glass cases, looking for discontinued stuff you owned when it was new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittystuff1large.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="hellokittystuff1large" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittystuff1large.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittystuff2large.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="hellokittystuff2large" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittystuff2large.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are the oddly poignant moments, like this vignette documenting Hello Kitty fandom through “life’s stages.” There are wedding champagne glasses, baby stuff, and then … a walker … and then … yes, a grave statuette. Dang, Sanrio. Dang, museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittylifestageslarge.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="420" alt="hellokittylifestageslarge" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittylifestageslarge.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the real emotional coup de grace by &lt;em&gt;Hello!&lt;/em&gt;. That comes actually right outside the exhibit’s doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you hit the second floor of the whole thing, there are technically two ways to exit, but the most logical one following the flow of the exhibit leads you past this awesome Hello-Kitty-as-Sphinx statue.…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittysphinx.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img height="747" alt="hellokittysphinx" width="560" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hellokittysphinx.jpeg?w=560&amp;amp;h=747"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and into a section of the museum’s long-term exhibition &lt;em&gt;Common Ground: The Heart of Community&lt;/em&gt;. It focuses largely on the U.S.’ long-running racism against Asians, and a detailed history of post-WWII Japanese internment camps. Come for the cartoons, stay for the stark reminder that concentration camps existed on our soil, and some of our grandparents might have lived in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe height="390" width="640" allowfullscreen="true" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6UXLlfyo5rY?version=3&amp;amp;rel=0#038;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" type="text/html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa. Nice one, Japanese American National Museum, for not-so-subtly showing us how dramatically cultural tides can change, and how it’s important not to forget our country’s darkest moments. Heavy stuff to take in while you’re wearing a free set of cardboard cat ears, but you’ve got to take the sweet with the sour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello! The Supercute World of Hello Kitty runs at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles through April 26, 2015. Visit &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.janm.org"&gt;janm.org&lt;/a&gt; for more details. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="html">Peter Thiel: Uber is ‘so obsessed with perceived enemies that it ends up making real enemies’</title>
        <published>2014-12-01T10:32:07Z</published>

        <summary type="html">In his new book “Zero to One”, Peter Thiel, the CEO of Palantir, co-founder of PayPal and early investor in Facebook, attempts to explain why some businesses fail and others succeed — and what kinds of societies produce the greatest volume of the latter.

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In his new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3APeter%20Thiel"&gt;“Zero to One”&lt;/a&gt;, Peter Thiel, the CEO of Palantir, co-founder of PayPal and early investor in Facebook, attempts to explain why some businesses fail and others succeed — and what kinds of societies produce the greatest volume of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a brief Q&amp;amp;A with Fusion, Thiel took some questions about the state of American tech, and what the future of the U.S., and the world, may eventually look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUSION: What two companies are you most excited about right now (besides your own) and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PETER THIEL:&lt;/strong&gt; Airbnb and SpaceX. The next $100 billion consumer internet company will be Airbnb: it opened a new market where most people saw only empty space. Elon Musk wants to open a whole new planet. His mission to Mars will take time, but SpaceX has already reengineered the rocket industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F: What lessons should we draw from Buzzfeed’s &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fbensmith%2Fuber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists&amp;amp;ei=RKB8VLD_Mo7esAS-sYGYBA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGe3C8RlKFclz-fL9TVXFZKVEfz3g&amp;amp;sig2=ebbrIcs3AUWZ8XBShsiE2Q&amp;amp;bvm=bv.80642063,d.cWc"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; about an Uber executive targeting a reporter — about the company itself, and about Silicon Valley?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PT:&lt;/strong&gt; It reveals a company so obsessed with perceived enemies that it ends up making real enemies. (Of course, I’m an investor in Lyft, so I’m biased.) For the Valley as a whole, it shows the downside of “disruption”: when you begin with an adversarial attitude toward business, you set yourself up as a target, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F: Did you read Thomas Piketty’s book on inequality (&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCapital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty%2Fdp%2F1491534656&amp;amp;ei=BJV8VKTMKMH7sASxzIHoAg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH-LRAHfANUhBFqQuffyOpX1-X4kA&amp;amp;sig2=yGtlql6BPcHK9yIOBifKYw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.80642063,d.cWc"&gt;“Capital in the 21st Century”&lt;/a&gt;)? Do the U.S. and the West have an inequality problem? If so, what can or should be done to address it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PT:&lt;/strong&gt; Piketty accurately describes inequality in the past and present of countries like the United States, but when it comes to the future he’s not even wrong: he traces a trend but doesn’t explain it, simply claiming it will continue unless we enact a global wealth tax. Piketty’s proposal is not just unworkable, it shows his whole premise to be strangely incoherent: at the global scale, inequality has been falling as millions of people in China and India escape poverty. Meanwhile, in the United States, the most urgent debate isn’t for or against inequality, it’s whether or not to accept stagnation. State and local regulations make it hard for people to start new occupations and even harder for anybody to build affordable housing. Those policies deny people opportunities every day in tangible ways, unlike the abstract idea of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F: What do you think Bitcoin will look like in 10 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PT:&lt;/strong&gt; The future of Bitcoin is binary: in ten years it will be either worthless or wildly valuable. To succeed, Bitcoin needs a payment system to complement what has so far been only a speculative currency. To get that done, politics will be a bigger challenge than engineering. I started PayPal because I believed that a secure internet currency would change the world, and I still think that’s true; the question is when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F: How should the world be tackling climate change? Have you changed your lifestyle at all to lower your carbon footprint? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PT:&lt;/strong&gt; In my life I focus on technology. Climate change is a planetary phenomenon, and at the global scale there are many more people desperately trying to increase their consumption than there are people trying to reduce it. But I don’t think we in the West can tell the world’s peasants to stay green and poor for the sake of the Earth. And changing our own lifestyles won’t be enough. People in richer countries should feel responsible for something harder than changing our habits: we should work to create new technology to solve energy problems for the entire world. If we don’t, all lifestyles everywhere are likely to be meager in fifty years, and nobody will have any choice about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">This week’s revelation of a deep, wide-ranging computer hack at Sony Pictures – which brought thousands of executive salaries, Social Security numbers, and other highly confidential documents out into the open – has sent shock waves through Hollywood studios, sparked rumors of North Korean involvement, and opened a FBI investigation. As Sony Pictures executives rushed to contain the leaks and […]</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week’s revelation of a &lt;a href="http://fusion.net/story/30850/more-from-the-sony-pictures-hack-budgets-layoffs-hr-scripts-and-3800-social-security-numbers/"&gt;deep, wide-ranging computer hack at Sony Pictures&lt;/a&gt; – which brought thousands of executive salaries, Social Security numbers, and other highly confidential documents out into the open – has sent shock waves through Hollywood studios, sparked rumors of North Korean involvement, and opened a FBI investigation. As Sony Pictures executives rushed to contain the leaks and lock down the company’s systems on Tuesday, the studio’s Culver City lot erupted in quiet pandemonium, as employees began to fear that their most private information would be made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Sony Pictures employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of angering studio management during a sensitive time, told me that the mood at the studio’s lot this week is one of confusion and panic, as workers try to figure out if their information is vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone’s looking to the IT department to say, ‘&lt;em&gt;How did you let this happen&lt;/em&gt;?'” said one employee in Sony Pictures’ finance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are in a frenzy, especially people in HR and finance,” an employee in the studio’s media relations department told me. “They’re all freaked out, and nobody knows what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chaos at Sony Pictures began last Monday morning, when an image of a skeleton with the phrase “Hacked By #GOP” appeared on computer screens at the company. (GOP is thought to stand for Guardians of Peace, a hacking group that is taking credit for the attack.) Sony Pictures’ network subsequently went down for two days, forcing employees to use personal e-mail accounts, work from home, and in &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/25/us-sony-cybersecurity-idUSKCN0J920720141125"&gt;some cases,&lt;/a&gt; resort to paper and pencil to do their work. Fearing a further hack of credit-card data, the shops and cafés on the studio’s lot switched to cash-only, and the Yogurtland frozen yogurt store located on the lot closed altogether. Even the corporate gym was affected, workers said, as the hack took its electronic sign-in system offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, employees lined up at the Sony Pictures lot to receive new login credentials for the corporate network, and were told not to log into their company-issued desktops until the breach had been resolved, according to two employees. Some employees set up makeshift Gmail accounts to hold their work-related communications, while others simply used their personal accounts. The studio eventually restored Internet access to many employees, but without access to their files, these workers found their normal routines interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just business as usual, if the year was 2002,” one Sony TV staffer wrote in a Facebook message. “[There are] lots of PAs having to run jump-drives back and forth all over the place, and hand delivering hard copies of files and scripts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite these annoyances, several employees said that the scope of the hack didn’t sink in until late Monday, when Fusion published a &lt;a href="http://fusion.net/story/30789/hacked-documents-reveal-a-hollywood-studios-stunning-gender-and-race-gap/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; detailing a leaked spreadsheet containing thousands of employee salaries. On Tuesday, Fusion also revealed that hackers had 3,800 employee Social Security numbers had been included in the leak, along with spreadsheets detailing hirings and firings, performance evaluations, and even division-by-division budgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I don’t think anyone understood the breadth of what was about to happen,” the media relations employee said. “Last week when we came into the offices, we were like, &lt;em&gt;is this a joke&lt;/em&gt;? It got real when the Social Security numbers got released.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the confusion were widespread rumors that the hack may have been connected to &lt;em&gt;The Interview&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming Sony comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, whose plot concerns an attempt to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. &lt;a href="http://recode.net/2014/11/28/sony-pictures-investigates-north-korea-link-in-hack-attack/"&gt;Several news outlets&lt;/a&gt; reported that Sony was investigating whether North Korean hackers may have coordinated the attack as retribution for the movie’s release. And Sony Pictures staffers joked amongst themselves that perhaps the hack itself had been a bit of clever hype for the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At first you heard lots of jokes like, ‘Oh man, can you imagine the publicity for this movie?'” the TV staffer said. “But I do think people got nervous about potentially having Social Security numbers floating around out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the half-dozen Sony Pictures employees I spoke to said they had heard about the leaks primarily from news reports, rather than from the company’s management. The lack of reliable information from their superiors contributed, they said, to an atmosphere of worry and speculation. Employees wondered how much financial damage the hack would do to Sony, and whether their year-end bonuses would be affected as a result. Temporary workers on the Sony Pictures lot (known as “red badges”) were not paid on schedule last week due to the network downtime, one employee said, which made many of them nervous. And fears about identity theft led many employees to change their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think anyone was really freaking out until they realized that not only did [hackers] get this information, but they’re releasing it,” the finance employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the sites that had hosted the leaked archives took them down on Monday, leaving Sony employees without a way to check if their data had been affected by the breach. On Tuesday, I received several e-mails from Sony Pictures employees, asking me to check if their names were among those listed in the documents. (Invariably, they were.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Pictures has not responded to my requests for comment. But the studio acknowledged on Tuesday that it had been the victim of a big attack. “It is now apparent that a large amount of confidential Sony Pictures Entertainment data has been stolen by the cyber attackers, including personnel information and business documents,” Sony chiefs Amy Pascal and Michael Lynton wrote to staffers, in a &lt;a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-lynton-amy-pascal-call-753546"&gt;memo obtained by The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;. They continued: “This theft of Sony materials and the release of employee and other information are malicious criminal acts, and we are working closely with law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Tuesday memo, the studio announced that all Sony Pictures employees would receive identity protection services from a third-party firm, AllClear ID. But the offer struck several Sony Pictures employees as too little, too late. The damage is already done, they said: the concern among the rank-and-file runs deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with their most sensitive personal information floating around the Internet, Sony Pictures employees are employees are left with little to do but keep abreast of the continued fallout from the hack, speculate on who might have been behind it, and hope that their data will stay safe from the worst forms of misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s totally the elephant in the room,” the media relations employee told me. “Every hour, something else gets released, and it’s like, ‘&lt;em&gt;What? What happened now?’&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://rest.contextly.com/statichtml/get/app_id/fusiondotnetwordpress/page_id/31116/#!related_links"&gt;Related&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/nationaljournal_black.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif.—Alex Murillo leans forward in his seat, sipping coffee from a shot glass and waving his hands as he talks. He points to the screen of his MacBook Pro, explaining the genius behind Audive, the mobile application he is developing that allows users to record cover songs and mix tracks with music enthusiasts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the secret sauce,” says Murillo, hitting a key on his computer that fills the air with the sound of a man singing in Italian. “You can bring in vocals from a guy in Italy or you can bring in the flamenco guitar from Spain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murillo has made this pitch about three times to potential investors in Silicon Valley since launching his start-up this summer. He came up with the idea and polished his pitch with the help of Manos Accelerator, a tech incubator focused on growing Latino-owned start-ups in America’s high-tech capital. He was one of six entrepreneurs chosen from a pool of 83 applicants to take part in Manos’s second accelerator program, which ended in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murillo moved to San Jose from Mexico with his wife nearly three years ago to take his chances in Silicon Valley. He had tried to launch a real-estate listings application back home, he said, but the business culture there was too resistant to change. Now Murillo and his five-person team are looking for an angel investor to give them enough money to get Audive started. He is also studying to get his CPA license, just in case the start-up plan doesn’t pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the backup plan,” says Murillo, 32, who worked in corporate finance for Siemens in Mexico. “It’s a dream for an entrepreneur to come here to Silicon Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds are against him. Less than 1 percent of venture-backed start-ups have a Latino cofounder, according to numbers from venture capital clearinghouse CB Insights. The lack of diversity at these investment firms and high-tech company has earned Silicon Valley nicknames such as the “white boys club.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very hard to tap into those circles,” says Edward Avila, CEO and cofounder of Manos Accelerator. “If you’re a Latino who didn’t go to Stanford University or the Ivy League schools, it’s a challenge. And Latinos don’t typically have wealthy friends and family to get them started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avila, 45, knows this firsthand. The San Jose native comes from a working-class family: His Costa Rican mother worked the assembly line at a fruit cannery, and his Mexican father was a shoe cobbler. Avila was the first in his family to go to college and has since worked for two decades in Silicon Valley as a human-resources executive for high-tech companies such as Western Digital and Phillips Semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avila, who launched his own start-up in 2011, says he remembers feeling like the only Latino entrepreneur in the room at networking events. His start-up never took off, and Avila decided to focus on supporting other Latino entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many people thought I was crazy,” he says. “To me it was a gut feeling. With all the Latinos we have in the U.S., you can’t tell me there aren’t entrepreneurs doing creative and innovative things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avila started Manos in 2013 with two cofounders: Sylvia Flores, a chemical engineer, and David Lopez, a computer technician (and Jennifer Lopez’s father). The group chose the name “Manos,”—the Spanish word for “hands”—to spread the message that Latinos can do more than manual labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their mission caught the attention of Google, which has partnered with Manos by providing mentors, resources, and some operating funds. Last fall, Manos brought its first group of entrepreneurs from seven start-ups to its shared office space in downtown San Jose. Participants developed business plans, marketing strategies, and elevator pitches. The 12-week program ended with a Demo Day at Yahoo’s headquarters in Sunnyvale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would really like to see a Juan Fernandez up there with Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg,” says Avila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of diversity in Silicon Valley gained national attention this summer when high-tech companies such as Apple and Yahoo released their workforce demographics for the first time. Their hiring reports show that Latinos and African-Americans make up less than 5 percent of their employees. The companies disclosed the numbers in response to mounting pressure from media and civil-rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;DEMOGRAPHICS AT TOP TECH COMPANIES, BY SHARE OF OVERALL WORKFORCE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/screen-shot-2014-12-03-at-9-38-03-pm.png"&gt;&lt;img height="571" alt="Screen shot 2014-12-03 at 9.38.03 PM" width="791" src="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/screen-shot-2014-12-03-at-9-38-03-pm.png?w=791&amp;amp;h=571"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tech companies’ most recent employee data shows that white and Asian employees make up the lion’s share of the Silicon Valley workforce. White employees represent more than half of the workforce for each company shown here and up to 60 percent in some cases. But other than Apple and Amazon, which offer more low-wage jobs in their stores and warehouses, representation for black, Hispanic and multiracial employees at other companies rarely hits 5 percent.  &lt;span&gt;(Source: Compiled from company equal opportunity reports)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alejandro Quintero worked for years as one of the few Latino engineers at Silicon Valley companies such as Cisco and Logitech. In 2012, he decided to quit his job and work full time on getting his own company off the ground. Last year, he and his partner launched Cuestioname, a social platform that allows people to pose questions to government officials and other leaders. Social-media users can then vote on questions they would like answered, giving government agencies an idea of which questions they should respond to first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quintero, 40, participated in the second accelerator program at Manos, which ended in August. The Venezuelan native said Manos has helped him make connections and get exposure in the competitive Silicon Valley tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way it works in the valley is, it’s all about building trust,” says Quintero, a telecommunications engineer. “We have a bigger ladder to climb because we are a minority that hasn’t had a big impact here the way Asians and Indians have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step for Manos is developing a network of angel investors willing to take a chance on their entrepreneurs. Getting that initial investment of $50,000 to $100,000 is crucial for the start-ups to succeed, Avila says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, Manos held its first three-day boot camp for prospective investors as part of the Manos Angel Network. The group of seven investors learned the basics of investing in early-stage ventures and heard pitches from 11 entrepreneurs, including Quintero and Murillo. At the end of program, they all voted on which start-up would get their $50,000 investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winner was Silicon Valley-based Survmetrics, which allows businesses to create customer surveys designed for smartphone users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were very impressed,” says Alejandro Estrada, a Visa executive who is looking to become a full-time angel investor. “It seemed like a good strategy for a market that already exists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Manos start-ups are also negotiating contracts with angel investors, Avila says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Audive or Cuestioname didn’t attract support from these investors, Murillo and Quintero didn’t seem too upset. Launching a start-up in America’s innovation capital is not supposed to be easy, Quintero says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The job is not glamorous at all,” he says. “You have to go and pitch and pitch again, because you never know if an investor will be calling you tomorrow. You just have to keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Journal&lt;em&gt; recently visited Silicon Valley to see how immigration and technology have transformed the San Jose area. In the coming weeks, Next America will publish a series of stories about the people who are finding their place in America’s wealthiest region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We still don’t know who is behind the devastating hack of Sony Pictures, which has released thousands of confidential documents and sensitive personnel files from the Hollywood mega-studio into the open. Sony Pictures and the FBI are &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/business/sony-pictures-and-fbi-investigating-attack-by-hackers.html"&gt;reportedly investigating&lt;/a&gt; multiple possible entry points into the studio’s systems, including illicit access through a disgruntled current or former Sony employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most colorful scenario, by far, is one that officials &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-02/north-korea-s-fingerprints-said-found-in-sony-hacking.html"&gt;aren’t yet ruling out&lt;/a&gt;: the possibility that Sony Pictures was hacked by North Korean agents as retribution for &lt;em&gt;The Interview, &lt;/em&gt;a soon-to-be-released comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. The movie’s plot concerns an assassination attempt on the life of Kim Jong Un, the hermit kingdom’s supreme leader, and news of the movie’s impending release had &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/10973720/North-Korea-appeals-to-White-House-to-halt-release-of-US-comedy-film.html"&gt;outraged North Korean officials&lt;/a&gt;. The country’s anger about the movie, it is speculated, could have prompted the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been poring through the Sony Pictures documents all week, noting &lt;a href="http://fusion.net/story/30850/more-from-the-sony-pictures-hack-budgets-layoffs-hr-scripts-and-3800-social-security-numbers/"&gt;executive salaries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://fusion.net/story/30838/does-a-powerful-sony-pictures-partnership-have-a-gender-pay-gap/"&gt;gender pay disparities&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://fusion.net/story/31227/sony-pictures-hack-spreads-to-deloitte-thousands-of-audit-firms-salaries-are-leaked/"&gt;hacked data from a major accounting firm&lt;/a&gt;. And recently, we came across another fascinating document: the production budget for &lt;em&gt;The Interview, &lt;/em&gt;the very film that may have set the hack in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movie budgets are highly confidential, due to the many suppliers and celebrities they involve, and the exorbitant price tags on some of the materials and services. But there it was in the leaked archives, in between HR documents, marketing plans, and healthcare summaries. We’ve embedded excerpts from the budget below, so you can take your own look at the inner workings of the movie that may (emphasis: &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt;) have put Sony Pictures at the center of one of the biggest cyber-crimes ever to hit corporate America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few highlights from the 210-page document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Interview&lt;/em&gt;‘s total budget ended up being $44 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seth Rogen and James Franco were both paid $6.5 million to star in the movie, which was shot in Vancouver. Rogen also got a “perk fund” totaling $20,000, and additional money for directing and producing the movie, bringing his total haul to $8.4 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rogen and Franco appear to have gotten&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;paid to &lt;em&gt;drive themselves to work. &lt;/em&gt;Lines in the budget that read “S. ROGEN SELF DRIVE” and “J. FRANCO SELF DRIVE” are listed with costs of $9,500 and $6,000, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyoncé and Jay-Z made cameos in the film (for which they were paid $10,000 apiece, and given first-class plane tickets). Which seems reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kevin Federline made a cameo, too, but only got $5,000 for his troubles. Which does not seem reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are four roles in the film named “Hot Korean Girl,” and one named simply “Korean Girl.” Luckily, all got paid the same amount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony Pictures hired both a “Korean advisor” and “military advisor” for the film.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The studio hired a drone pilot for aerial shots, at a cost of $2,658.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zooey Deschanel, Michael Vick, Sylvester Stallone, Brad Pitt, and Neil Patrick Harris are all listed on the budget, perhaps as extras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list of shot requirements on p. 85 reads like a bizarre extended haiku. (“TANK FIRES, TANK ROUND IMPACTS, YU SHOT, KOH POOS, ORANGE FALLS FROM BASKET, HE RIPS OFF SOOK’S BLOUSE. SHE RIPS OFF…”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will apparently be two tigers on set, complete with veterinarian, trainers, and a “tiger accommodation.” Total cost: nearly $74,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$44 million may sound like a lot of money to Hollywood outsiders, but keep in mind that it’s much less than Sony Pictures has put up for other projects. (The studio &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323971204578628850785476418"&gt;spent&lt;/a&gt; a reported $150 million on the 2013 flop &lt;em&gt;After Earth&lt;/em&gt;.) And all the tigers and driving allowances will look puny compared to the money Sony Pictures will spend dealing with the fallout from the film, if in fact it did prompt a North Korean cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="html">The Future of Whole Foods [Future of Retail]</title>
        <published>2014-12-05T09:30:51Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.psfk.com/2014/12/future-whole-foods-future-retail.html" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="266" alt="WholeFoods_Ofthefuture" width="474" src="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WholeFoods_Ofthefuture-700x393.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After identifying key trends and actions in the &lt;a href="http://www.psfk.com/report/future-of-retail-2015"&gt;2015 Future of Retail Report&lt;/a&gt;, PSFK asked creative agencies from around the world to imagine how those recommendations would manifest for real brands. &lt;a href="https://rehabstudio.com/"&gt;Rehabstudio&lt;/a&gt; implemented numerous recommendations including &lt;a href="http://www.psfk.com/2014/11/personalizing-recommendations-inspire-consumer-confidence.html"&gt;Everyone Of A Kind&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.psfk.com/2014/11/retail-2015-be-the-hub.html"&gt; Be The Hub&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.psfk.com/2014/12/www.psfk.com/2014/12/kill-the-checkout"&gt;Kill the Checkout &lt;/a&gt;to reinvent the grocery shopping experience for &lt;a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/"&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rehabstudio’s activation personalizes interactions at Whole Foods by incorporating information and creating an interactive environment through personal electronics. Upon entering the store, the shopper’s mobile device would recognize they are in a Whole Foods. It would give the wearer contextual suggestions based on availability, location, and history to give users additional information about staying healthy.  Creative partner at rehabstudio Tim Rodgers explains, “Wearable devices allow for a hands-free, personalized, and private guided experience in a retail environment. It’s like having a personal shopper guide you around the store, it knows what the consumer likes, what they might want to try and buy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="266" alt="WholeFoods_PersonalisedTour" width="474" src="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WholeFoods_PersonalisedTour-700x393.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push notifications would help educate users on the products they are purchasing.  “It’s important that we’re always adding value to the consumer,” Rodgers elaborates, “When the consumer opts into the recommendations, it immediately provides value because the interaction is useful.” The experience has been engineered to encourage impulse purchases throughout the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="266" alt="WholeFoods_Checkout" width="474" src="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WholeFoods_Checkout-700x393.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the checkout counter, the shopper simply sets down their basket to see an electronic preview of their products with additional product suggestions they can add to their baskets. They can opt for same-day home delivery to avoid having to carry a large bag home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how the interaction would play out in this scenario for Adam as he shops for a special dinner for his girlfriend, Jenny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="PSFK - Whole Foods of the Future" height="267" width="474" allowfullscreen src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/110181755"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="291" alt="WholeFoods_Kitchen" width="474" src="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WholeFoods_Kitchen-700x431.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rehabstudio also redesigned the store’s layout replacing aisles with inviting open spaces, a community kitchen, and gardens. They imagine a rotating stock to reflect the seasons, holidays, and current trends accompanied by in-store demonstrations. By offering these services, Whole Foods becomes a hub for all activities surrounding food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="292" alt="WholeFoods_Floorplan" width="474" src="http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WholeFoods_Floorplan-700x432.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At rehabstudio we believe that that in-store retail is going to be less about holding and flogging goods, and more about offering exciting branded experiences. The technology used to support these experiences, from augmented reality through to beacons, will sink or swim depending on how seamless it is, how personalized it can be, and how much value it can add to the consumer,“ says Rodgers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach to the future of grocery shopping encourages customers to engage with the store so the focus is not on picking up basics, but rather on learning about what to eat, how to eat it, and discovering new foods.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-levin/is-gordon-gekko-reading-y_b_6271786.html?utm_hp_ref=technology&amp;ir=Technology" type="text/html"/>

        <summary type="html">The latest greatest swindlers in the cybercrime racket know you're onto their digital three-card monte, and they've made a few adjustments, putting yet another wrinkle in the corporate-hacking game by targeting top-level employees for major profits.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These hackers appear to be based in North America or Western Europe, and they know a great deal about the companies and industries they've been cracking. They could be the cyber version of Gordon Gekko or just good studies of character. It really doesn't matter. Here's what counts: They are hatching schemes so nuanced you may not see the hack that takes out your company till the smoke clears.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These hackers may have worked for your company, or one like it. They are going to know how your teams communicate. They'll use the lingo and shorthand that you see every day. Emails may be super simple, like, &amp;quot;I need another pair of eyes on this spreadsheet about [term of art only people in your business would know].&amp;quot; They may know what you are likely to be talking about after certain kinds of industry news releases, and they'll have a good idea of what times of day get busy for you so that you are more distracted and &lt;a title="3 Dumb Things You Can Do With Email" href="http://www.credit.com/personal-finance/3-dumb-things-you-can-do-with-email/?utm_source=HuffPo&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_content=IB_1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=colleague_criminal_work"&gt;less likely to think before you click&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;The attacks are becoming much more sophisticated than anything we've seen before,&amp;quot; says Jen Weedon, a threat intelligence officer at the Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity firm FireEye.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/technology/hackers-target-biotech-companies.html"&gt;reported this week about one such group of hackers&lt;/a&gt; targeting senior executives at biotech companies with a goal of garnering insider information to game the stock market.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
FireEye has been tracking the group, which they call Fin4 -- for a year and a half. (The &amp;quot;Fin&amp;quot; designation is assigned by the company to indicate groups where the main goal is to monetize proprietary information.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Fin4 has reached a threshold of capability that sets them apart,&amp;quot; Weedon told me during a phone conversation. &amp;quot;They are very thoughtful about who they target. They go after specific companies and are a lot more scoped in their approach.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Attacks of this kind may start with the studied &lt;a title="Why Hackers Want to Be Your Friend" href="http://blog.credit.com/2014/05/why-hackers-want-to-be-your-friend-81875/?utm_source=HuffPo&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;amp;utm_campaign=colleague_criminal_work"&gt;e-impersonation&lt;/a&gt; of trusted colleagues, business associates or anyone from a constellation of contacts -- compliance officers, regulators, legal or financial advisers -- with the single purpose of getting someone in a senior position to personally, unwittingly hand over the keys to the castle. Once they are in, sensitive -- potentially lucrative -- information can be accessed and put to use.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;They will send a very convincing phishing email,&amp;quot; Weedon said. &amp;quot;It may prompt a link that looks just like Outlook.&amp;quot; The target enters their credentials to see the attachment, not realizing that they were not in Outlook at all. There may even be a legitimate document on the other side of that fake login page, but it's a trap. Once the hacker gets into a key person's inbox, Outlook settings have been reset to send any messages containing the words &amp;quot;hacked&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;malware&amp;quot; directly to the user's trash folder, thereby giving the cyber-ninja more time in the system to collect information about mergers and acquisitions, compliance issues, press releases, non-public market-moving information--anything that can be used to make a smarter stock market trade.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Weedon, the group has been able to infiltrate email accounts at the CEO level.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Once they've gained access, the hackers may simply collect everything in the CEO's inbox or take an attachment found there and plant malware that then spreads throughout the company thereby exposing still more information. The difference here is that the hack relies on legitimate credentials to gain access, so it's a much lighter touch with potentially much more information being comprised. If the hackers forgo &lt;a title="5 Risky Things You're Doing on Your Work Computer" href="http://blog.credit.com/2014/12/5-risky-things-youre-doing-on-your-work-computer-102888/?utm_source=HuffPo&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_content=IB_4&amp;amp;utm_campaign=colleague_criminal_work"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt;, there aren't necessarily any traces at all of the compromise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; way these breaches worked--one still very much practiced by Chinese and Russian groups -- involved the use of general information, kinda-sorta knowledge of the target's business and hit-or-miss English. Because there is often less specificity and more variables in these kinds of softer attacks, the dodge is easier to spot. It's more likely to find a lower-level employee falling for it. In most cases, these targets don't have the kind of access to information that can cause major damage. Having gained whatever access is possible through their mark, old-school hackers move laterally into the organization's environment, whether by recording keystrokes to exploit privileged employee credentials or blasting a hole in the company firewall. They might as well be Bonnie and Clyde robbing a bank. The goal is to &lt;a title="What is Identity Theft?" href="http://www.credit.com/identity-theft-protection/?utm_source=HuffPo&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_content=IB_5&amp;amp;utm_campaign=colleague_criminal_work#what-is-identity-theft"&gt;siphon off information that can be turned into an easy profit&lt;/a&gt;, but the process leaves traces.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What's so worrisome about Fin4 is that they can come and go -- gaining access to everything and anything pertaining to your company -- and you may never know it.

And before he consumed the first meal in space, there was no certainty that the absence of gravity would have allowed him to swallow without suffocating. There were complaints from the first guinea pigsJohn Glenn swore that the beef mush that was given to him was truly inedible. The problem with the edibility of space food has been resolved through time and reached its peak with cases like the floating M&amp;amp;Ms that made all the astronauts of the space shuttle real happy in 1981. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the ISS food resemble an archive of plastic documents placed on a wall in alphabetical order. There are some freeze-dried meals that are only waiting for a few drops of hot water to come back to life or to be thermostabilized in a portable microwave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cocktail of freeze-dried shrimps seems to be the top choice, followed by semi-dehydrated tortillas filled with any desired topping, and the evergreen M&amp;amp;Ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-original-width="670" data-original-height="440" alt="" src="http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/17388/1417717160015759.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronaut Loren J. Shriver on board the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Image: NASA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the era of the toothpaste meals, todays food is light years away. There is so much difference from back then that astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti decided to initiate a campaign on the importance of eating healthy food, even in orbit. With the hope of eating some healthy space food, we contacted Samanthas cook, Stefano Polato, and talked about space coffee, restaurants across the universe, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://avamposto42.esa.int/"&gt;Avamposto42&lt;/a&gt;, the blog that narrates the culinary adventures of Samanthas team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motherboard: &lt;/strong&gt;The company you work for, Argotec, is the official supplier of bonus food for the ISS. Bonus food means extra food, as opposed to the standard fare? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stefano Polato: &lt;/strong&gt;Its the food for big occasions, the personal food of every astronaut. Lets say that each one of them has the entire Russian and American pantry at their disposalthat resembles the old K ration. And then they have my bonus food on a weekly basis. Recently, we sent 11 bonus food containers, but they wont last for the entire six month period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are Samantha Cristoforettis personal chef. Does every astronaut have a personal chef? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically yes. Including every astronauts personal chef, the people from Argotec, including myself, also deal with the research process. I already worked for a big company that distributes food; this offered me a discrete expertise in the area. It was a way to continue on a path I was already covering, and in addition to that, I got a chance to work with Samantha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the food already assembled? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, Samanthas idea is to combine pre-assembled food (rice or pasta to heat up) to separated ingredients to personalize/customize the recipes. This is a novelty. We supplied Samantha with an actual food supply: she will be able to combine the ingredients according to her tastes, to create a personalized menu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any other novelties in the food arena? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We placed particular attention to Samanthas physical health. We worked side by side with an expert nutritionist, Filippo Ongaro, with whom we planned her menu. The aim is to try and confront the problems that astronauts face; to contain/control cellular aging, for example, we used a lot of antioxidants. The crucial aspect was to guarantee the right amount of nutritional substances: proteins mostly, but also fiber. Thats why we used a lot of whole grain cereals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food we provide has to give energy for longer periods of time and shouldnt be burned immediately, like in the case of refined cereals. The initial idea was to give her food that allowed her to face any activity she had to accomplish in the best way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-original-width="992" data-original-height="744" alt src="http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/17388/1417717269821348.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coffee maker made by Argotec in collaboration with Lavazza. Image: Argotec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the cooking techniques? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used thermostabilization that starts with vacuum-sealed cooking at a low temperature. Some restaurants on Earth also use this technique, as it preserves the foods flavours and colors. Another avantgarde process in the gastronomy/cookery domain is freeze-drying, a technique that allows to safeguard every nutritional value: you place an ingredient at -80 degrees and then you raise it up again, in a sterile environment with no air, so that water can sublime from its solid state to get to its gaseous one. Once all the water has been sucked in, the food becomes dry and dense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If someone wanted to cook some pasta in the ISS, he or she wouldnt be able to boil the water because it would spread around everywhere... right? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Also, the maximum parameter for temperature dictated by NASA is 80 degrees. If any liquid were to disperse in the station, the astronauts would risk serious burns and damages to the machineries if the temperature went beyond 80 degrees. We played a lot on combined pressure, trying to get to 80 degrees nevertheless. The extremely high pressure compensates those 20 degrees that the temperature is missing when boiling in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about coffee? Can you drink it in a glass? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, they get to drink it in a pouch, a bag with a straw and a valve. The coffee machine makes expresso in bags, but technically it functions just like the ones we have on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The greatest novelty in the latest missions is their relevance on the internet and on social networks. You guys from Samanthas team grasped this occasion to initiate a campaign to raise awareness on the importance of healthy food. How did you come up with this idea? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since we met, Samantha expressly asked me for quality food that could raise awareness on the concept of healthy food. Avamposto 42 is a blog where we narrate our adventure with space food, grasping the occasion to touch on important issues that also involve terrestrial food habits. We appeal to the principles and values of the &amp;quot;slow food&amp;quot; movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 42 comes from Douglas Adams? Have you read The Restaurant at the End of the Universe? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Samantha and I met thanks to that story. From then on, I read every one of them. I find it a coincidence because 42 was also the number of her mission everything seemed to flow in the same directions so we came up with the idea of Avamposto42. Samantha is very close to that number. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-original-width="736" data-original-height="432" alt src="http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/17388/1417717342200455.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Argotec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I read on Avamposto42 that the food for Samantha was also created to be shared among her colleagues. Why is that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to give importance to the notion of sharing in addition to the one of nutrition. We see it as an occasion to leave behind the idea of nutrition as an end in itself... [We created] meals that could represent the Italian traditionolive oil, Italian chocolate, balsamic vinegar from Modena. We wanted it to be shared among the whole space crew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sense of taste and the sense of smell change in space? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question varies: some say they couldnt taste salt and sugar, others claim that they didnt feel any change at all. We will find out when Samantha will reach outer space. However, we played a lot with tastes, with spices, we exaggerated a bit sometimes. Eating tasty and variated food is important also for your mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the science museum in New York they sell bags of astronaut food. Does Argotec suggest similar ideas? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 23rd of October, we opened an e-commerce website where we also sell these products. We are in the European Space Agency centres of every country in Europe, and in shops. The applications of our knowledge on long-life foods are vast, we are able to supply food for extreme activities of various kinds, not just for space. For example, we supplied spelaeologists in the ESA Caves project and we will also have Alex Bellini as a client, an adventurer who will climb an iceberg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you like to cook directly in the ISS one day? Have you already thought of how to make up for the absence of gravity? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be amazing. Well, a lot of research should be done. But the idea fascinates me. All the physical dynamics would change: the sense of cold here on Earth tends towards the bottom. Up there, we dont find the shapes we have here. For example, a drop. It would be a radically new form of cookery/gastronomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could choose an ideal place to work in, would you pick the ISS? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course. I always strive for space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was translated from &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://motherboard.vice.com/it/read/mangiare-nello-spazio"&gt;Motherboard Italia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;H.P. Lovecraft is remembered as a brilliant fantasist, a creator of a completely unique universe of horror. He’s also remembered, unfortunately, as a &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/its_ok_to_admit_that_h_p_lovecraft_was_racist/"&gt;bigot&lt;/a&gt;. But the author whose head—to the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/17/world-fantasy-awards-hp-lovecraft-racism-row-statuette"&gt;chagrin&lt;/a&gt; of some—provided the model for the World Fantasy Award is not often remembered as a particularly good writer. Or rather, I should say, a particularly good stylist. His writing can sound stiflingly archaic, overstuffed with Victorianisms. “His prose, “&lt;a href="http://www.trollishdelver.com/2013/02/was-hp-lovecraft-actually-good-writer.html"&gt;writes Scott Malthouse&lt;/a&gt;, “can be turgid and adjectives suffocating,” and “his characters tend to be as thin as the paper they’re printed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writers love him, Malthouse argues, because he was such an original “world builder,” not because he was a fine artist. &lt;a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/08/why-we-still-write-lovecraft-pastiche"&gt;Elizabeth Bear at &lt;em&gt;Tor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; echoes the sentiment, writing that Lovecraft’s work is “criticized for its style, for its purpleness and density and failures of structure,” yet still evokes such a potent response that “the Lovecraftian universe must be considered a collaborative effort at this point,” since so many writers have furthered his “appealingly bleak” vision. You can download a &lt;a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/10/h-p-lovecrafts-classic-horror-stories-free-online.html"&gt;good part of his collected works in ebook and audiobook formats here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps he isn’t such a bad writer after all? In any case, he’s certainly a very distinctive one whose style, like Joseph Conrad’s, say, or even William Faulkner’s, endears readers precisely for its feverish excesses. Lovecraft himself was very self-conscious about his craft and took writing very seriously—enough to have published a lengthy, highly detailed essay called “&lt;a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/lc.aspx"&gt;Literary Composition&lt;/a&gt;” which tackles in several paragraphs a host of issues the writer must contend with: grammar, “reading,” vocabulary, “elemental phrases,” description, narration, “fictional narration,” “unity, mass, coherence,” and “forms of composition.” We won’t recite the whole of his advice here—you can &lt;a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/lc.aspx"&gt;read the whole thing for yourself&lt;/a&gt;. But to give you some of the flavor of Lovecraft’s pedagogy, we bring you his list of twenty “types of mistakes” young writers make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See his complete list below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erroneous plurals of nouns, as &lt;em&gt;vallies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;echos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barbarous compound nouns, as &lt;em&gt;viewpoint&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;upkeep&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want of correspondence in number between noun and verb where the two are widely separated or the construction involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ambiguous use of pronouns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erroneous case of pronouns, as &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;, and vice versa, or phrases like “between you and &lt;em&gt;I,&lt;/em&gt;” or “Let &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; who are loyal, act promptly.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erroneous use of &lt;em&gt;shall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;, and of other auxiliary verbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of intransitive for transitive verbs, as “he &lt;em&gt;was graduated&lt;/em&gt; from college,” or vice versa, as “he &lt;em&gt;ingratiated&lt;/em&gt; with the tyrant.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of nouns for verbs, as “he &lt;i&gt;motored&lt;/i&gt; to Boston,” or “he &lt;i&gt;voiced&lt;/i&gt; a protest,”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Errors in moods and tenses of verbs, as “If I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; he, I should do otherwise”, or “He said the earth &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The split infinitive, as “&lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; calmly ”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The erroneous perfect infinitive, as “Last week I expected &lt;em&gt;to have met&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False verb-forms, as “I &lt;em&gt;pled&lt;/em&gt; with him.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt;, as “I strive to write &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; Pope wrote.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misuse of prepositions, as “The gift was bestowed &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; an unworthy object,” or “The gold was divided &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; the five men.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The superfluous conjunction, as “I wish &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you to do this.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of words in wrong senses, as “The book greatly &lt;em&gt;intrigued&lt;/em&gt; me”, “&lt;em&gt;Leave&lt;/em&gt; me take this”, “He was &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; with the idea”, or “He is a &lt;em&gt;meticulous&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erroneous use of non-Anglicised foreign forms, as “a strange &lt;em&gt;phenomena&lt;/em&gt;”, or “two &lt;em&gt;stratas&lt;/em&gt; of clouds”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of false or unauthorised words, as &lt;em&gt;burglarise&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;supremest&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Errors of taste, including vulgarisms, pompousness, repetition, vagueness, ambiguousness, colloquialism, bathos, bombast, pleonasm, tautology, harshness, mixed metaphor, and every sort of rhetorical awkwardness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Errors of spelling and punctuation, and confusion of forms such as that which leads many to place an apostrophe in the possessive pronoun &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this is solid, common sense writing advice. Some of it isn’t. As with all things Lovecraft, you would be wise to use your discretion. A full read of Lovecraft’s &lt;a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/lc.aspx"&gt;treatise on composition&lt;/a&gt; will give you some sense of how to begin writing your own Lovecraft pastiche. For even more of his advice on the writing of fiction—particularly, as he called it, “weird fiction,” see his list of &lt;a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/10/h-p-lovecraft-gives-five-tips-for-drafting-a-horror-story-or-any-piece-of-weird-fiction.html"&gt;five tips for horror writing&lt;/a&gt;, which we featured in October.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">When some people hear I'm studying Spanish, they say, &amp;quot;Why bother? Pretty soon we'll have Google Glass, or Google Implant, to do the translation for us.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Is it true?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Will we listen to a Chinese speaker and hear English? Will we speak English and have it come out as Russian? Will Google Pluto language learning the way calculators did long division?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My interest goes beyond my own struggles to learn Spanish. I'm interested because, surprisingly, I find myself on a quest to learn how bilingualism might become the norm in America rather than the exception. That is, how most Americans might speak English plus another language of their choice. It seems clear that technology will play a role in accomplishing that transformation--that, or make it completely unnecessary. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But which?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Silicon Valley's Singularity U&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As it turned out, a friend put me on a path to an answer. I was catching up with Lawton Langford, a businessman, philanthropist, and learning addict, who was raving about a week he spent out in Silicon Valley studying the future. It was called &lt;a target="_hplink" href="http://singularityu.org/"&gt;Singularity University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Singularity University, or SU, is a five-year old educational experiment dedicated to helping people harness exponentially growing technologies to solve the world's greatest challenges. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Attending SU was a commitment of time and money, but I knew it might be the best chance I would have to learn where technology was going, and perhaps I'd be able to ask my burning question about the future of language learning to some experts at Google (which is a major sponsor of SU). Besides, I was about to turn 60 and decided that going to school for a week was a wiser birthday present to myself than upgrading my old Porsche. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My week in SU boot camp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My driver from the San Francisco Airport stops at the NASA gatehouse, rolls down his window and says, &amp;quot;Singularity.&amp;quot; The guard nods and the gate opens. About a mile into campus, past a gigantic exoskeleton of what I come to learn is an historic blimp hangar, we come to a stop before a one-story building where young people sit at tables awaiting this week's arrivals. Vertical banners with the Singularity University logo, which reminds me of the Superman logo, flutter in the California breeze. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Registering with me are about 70 others, ranging in age from 20-something to 60-something, and mostly from outside the U.S. For some reason there's a large contingent from Holland. Other countries represented include South Africa, Korea, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and Australia. Most are in business but one is from the U.S Marines and there are two young Navy Seals. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Our home for a week is the NASA Ames Research Campus, which looks like it hasn't changed since the Apollo program. My room has twin beds and two metal lockers that can be secured with padlocks, which is when I realize I'm lucky to have a room to myself. I imagine that during the Space Race, engineers and astronauts slept here. The towels remind me of what they issued in my high school gym.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But our Spartan quarters have one advantage: they are just steps away from the big classroom and the adjoining cafeteria, all of which are open day and night. The classroom is a converted dining hall with a variety of tables, some high, some low, lots of whiteboards, and a stage. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We eat our meals outside under umbrellas at picnic tables. The weather, soft as a baby blanket, fosters the close connections that begin to form among my fellow attendees and speakers who eat with us. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A fair number of us join the 7 a.m. exercise class led by a seemingly good-natured young man named James. I say &amp;quot;seemingly&amp;quot; because he invents fiendish jumping drills, &amp;quot;Spiderman pushups&amp;quot; (picture climbing up the sides of buildings, but on the ground), and torturous running drills on the basketball court, making for the longest 30 minutes I can remember. I'm grateful to be able to limp back to my room for a shower before breakfast and another 14 hours of classes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Notes to the future (39 pages of them)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During the week, we hear inspiring and sometimes shocking addresses from luminaries in the many fields that are going exponential. We hear Brad Templeton on future computing and driverless cars and Rob Nail on robots. Salim Ismail holds forth on the topic of his new book,&lt;a target="_hplink" href="http://www.exponentialorgs.com/"&gt; Exponential Organizations&lt;/a&gt;: Why new organizations are ten times better, faster, and cheaper than yours (and what to do about it). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Paul Saffo captivates with the practices and perils of forecasting the future, Neil Jacobstein speaks on how we are responsible for our technologies, even if we don't understand them. Peter Diamandis, the X-prize man and SU co-founder, speaks once on his book &lt;a target="_hplink" href="http://www.diamandis.com/abundance/"&gt;Abundance&lt;/a&gt;, and again on his forthcoming book &lt;a target="_hplink" href="http://www.diamandis.com/introduction/join-my-bold-mission/940/"&gt;Bold.&lt;/a&gt; He says, &amp;quot;We haven't seen 1% of the change that's going to happen in the next 10 years.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We hear Daniel Kraft on the future of medicine, Raymond McCauley on biotechnology (&amp;quot;If I want to learn something, I start a company&amp;quot;). Marc Goodman speaks on cyber security, the unseen deep web, and his upcoming book &lt;a target="_hplink" href="http://knopfdoubleday.com/futurecrimes/"&gt;Future Crimes&lt;/a&gt;. George Skidmore talks about nanotechnology, Gregg Maryniak on energy, Stanley Mazor on how Moore's Law played out during his decades in the Valley, Ramez Naam on our planet's health, Scott Summit on 3D printing, Jeremy Howard on data science. Divya Chander, an M.D. and professor at Stanford, told us about her brain research.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I filled 39 pages with dense notes--the old fashioned way: in my (paper) notebook, with a fine-point pen. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The climax of the presentations comes Thursday evening. It is Ray Kurzweil, the co-founder of SU and author of &lt;a target="_hplink" href="http://www.singularity.com/aboutthebook.html"&gt;The Singularity Is Near.&lt;/a&gt; Of all the people who could answer my question on the future of language learning technology, Kurzweil might be the best on the planet. And as it happened, I was about to have the chance to ask him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The man who will live forever?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Forbes magazine has good reason to call Kurzweil the &amp;quot;rightful heir to Thomas Edison.&amp;quot; Kurzweil invented the first commercial text-to-speech synthesizer and the first speech-recognition device. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, has been received by three U.S. Presidents, and holds 20 honorary doctorates. Besides directing his own companies, he is currently director of engineering at Google. Larry Page, Google's co-founder, asked Kurzweil to &amp;quot;bring natural language understanding to Google.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Forget about the search bar. Imagine talking to Google as you would a smart and funny friend.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When Ray Kurzweil says he expects to live forever, and expects you to do the same, it's hard to take him seriously. You want to write him off as some kind of chipped genius, something like Linus Pauling, who, despite winning two Nobel Prizes, insisted on thinking Vitamin C was a wonder drug. The problem is, everything else Ray Kurzweil says just makes so much sense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Copies of his most recent book, &lt;a target="_hplink" href="http://www.howtocreateamind.com/the-book.php"&gt;How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed&lt;/a&gt;, are stacked up for us to take and have him sign after his talk. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On stage for what is billed as a fireside chat, he sits perched on a stool flanked by two large monitors showing synched videos of a fireplace, blazing away. He launches into a monologue for some 45 minutes, confirming his belief that most of us should be able to live forever. &amp;quot;I'm certainly planning to,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;So wear your seat belt and avoid extreme sports.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It's easier to fathom the rest of his talk. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2029 and the coming digital neocortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He reiterates his prediction, made some years ago, that artificial intelligence (AI) will reach parity with human intelligence in 2029. Parity will be fleeting, however, as AI soars exponentially past us bio-bound humans. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Humans have always used our tools to improve our capabilities, says Kurzweil. Artificial intelligence and the coming digital neocortex--when human intelligence escapes the biological limitation of neurons and skulls--are no different. AI won't be a technology apart from us, it will be us. It is the natural outcome of the evolution we've been engaged in for millions of years. Evolution is just going beyond natural biology and merging with, and being enhanced by, digital evolution. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Our own biological brains are already being greatly aided by the exponentially growing digital neocortex, Kurzweil says. We are outsourcing our documents, our photographs, and our memories to the cloud, and we're just beginning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When he finishes and opens to questions, hands shoot up. Finally he acknowledges mine. The room pauses as a staff member jogs over to hand me the microphone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I say: &amp;quot;Around the world there are millions of people working hard to learn a second language--I'm one of them. What advice do you have for us?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kurzweil begins his answer by explaining how our minds process language, how ideas are represented in a hierarchy in our neocortex. (After a few seconds, I think to hit the record button on my phone.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;So when we invented language,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;I could actually take this hierarchy of symbols in my neocortex, which represented an idea, and I could transfer that to your neocortex through the medium of language.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Google Translate is pretty good now, compared with professional translators, he explains, and it's getting better fast, but it won't catch up to our own brainpower &amp;quot;until we achieve humans' levels, which I think is 2029.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then: &amp;quot;I think we will use that technology to make ourselves better.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He explains it this way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Language is not just a complete redundancy, as I'm sure you appreciate. Different languages have different metaphors and different idioms, and can express things in poetic ways that you just can't do in another language. There are French expressions, Yiddish expressions that you can't communicate in the same way in English. That's a general phenomenon, so preserving languages that are about to go extinct is...a very worthwhile endeavor, it's preserving a very valuable part of our human knowledge, both to study popular languages and orphan languages.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kurzweil then talks about his recent disagreement with Larry Page. Page had said he thought it was good that humans won't have to work much in the future. Kurzweil doesn't see it that way. The point is not to use technology to make us weaker, but stronger. &amp;quot;We can learn more languages. We'll become better at it as we make ourselves smarter.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I had feared that Kurzweil might say that we should forget about language learning, but he said just the opposite--that we should use technology to help us learn at ever higher levels. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Technology with a human touch still&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have a Spanish tutor named Angie who was raised in Colombia before coming to the U.S. as a teenager. She is a gifted teacher and speaks simply and slowly so I can understand. She corrects me kindly, while encouraging my progress, and gradually pushes me to use more advanced vocabulary and grammar. She is helping me evolve from rudimentary statements to something approaching adult conversation--so that I can be myself in my adopted language. Our typical 90-minute sessions fly by. I'm thrilled afterwards when I realize I've been conversing in Spanish the whole time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But with my schedule and Angie's, we meet only once a month, not nearly enough for me to make the progress I thirst for. But could I have an AI Angie with me all the time? I think that may be what Kurzweil has in mind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For while he is celebrated as a technologist, after hearing him speak and reading his most recent book, I think Kurzweil is a humanist. As much as he works toward reverse-engineering human intelligence, he values what humans are and is excited about what we can become.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kurzweil prizes our abilities to use language in its highest forms--philosophy, poetry, irony, sensuousness, humor and love.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Already our technology helps us learn languages more rapidly than in the past. In our pockets we carry unabridged dual-language dictionaries, electronic flash cards that keep track of what we need to practice, language games, even live video conferencing so we can speak with native speakers on the other side of the planet. Yet what we have today--while light years ahead of what was available just a generation ago--is nothing like what we'll have shortly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Soon we'll have AI Angies for scores of languages. These will be seemingly conscious intelligences who can understand what we're trying to say and encourage us to grow as a kind and wise tutor would. The point--and this is where we get into philosophy--is not to create substitutes for human interaction, but to prepare us to be the best humans we can be, better prepared for authentic conversations in multiple languages. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I smile when thinking how I will surprise my real Angie with how much I've learned with my AI tutor, so she can take me yet further into more meaningful, fluent conversations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Until then, with Kurzweil's encouragement, I'm going to keep working to learn Spanish with the tools we have. And I encourage you to use technology to learn your adopted language. Do so with the confidence of knowing the technology will improve daily to make your learning not easy, which isn't the point, but satisfyingly hard and deeply meaningful. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You will learn to read and write and hear, and finally, to speak with fluency. Just as we use a hammer to drive home a nail, we will use our expanding language-learning technology to drive home true language understanding. In that way, we will open ourselves to a broader understanding of this beautiful world and more of the people in it.</summary>

        <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://a5.files.readwrite.com/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_1.0,q_80,w_620/MTI2NDIxMDQ5NDM5OTg0MDk0.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a world of pure imagination and into reality, a German industrial firm is developing a trans-axis elevator with capabilities akin to those you might remember from fiction (or Hollywood). We're referring, of course, to the fictional traveling compartment operated by the London-based chocolate magnate from &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Willy Wonka's glass version, &lt;a href="http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/mediaplayer/video-271.html"&gt;ThyssenKrupp's MULTI elevator&lt;/a&gt; will offer intra-building travel, going up and down as well as sideways.  The only thing missing from the setup is a sociopathic dandy manning the controls and an ability to fly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/12/03/bluetooth-4-2-better-stronger-faster-wireless"&gt;Bluetooth SIG Unveils Better, Stronger, Faster Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming a lack of magic and Roald Dahl, what will ThyssenKrupp&lt;a href="http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/mediaplayer/video-271.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; use to create “the holy grail of the elevator industry”? Magnets, of course. The cables that currently enable elevators to go up and down restrict horizontal travel. Magnetic levitation, the same technology used on some types of monorails, will provide lifting force and stability for this elevator of the future. Even better, there's no chance the magnets will get tangled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trans-axis mobility isn't the only expected improvement on the horizontally limited elevators we use today. MULTI should, theoretically, be far more energy efficient. &lt;a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/transportation/mass-transit/maglev-elevators-will-take-you-up-down-and-sideways-by-2016"&gt;IEEE Spectrum reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MULTI will be more energy efficient than traditional cable elevators, and by running multiple cabins moving in a loop at up to 5 m/s, the maglev elevators will be able to carry 50 percent more people while reducing wait times to between 15 and 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shafts themselves will also be about half the size of elevator shafts that rely on cables, which means more room for developers to put in something useful, like even more elevators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThyssenKrupp is installing a MULTI prototype in an 800-foot building going up now in Rottweil, Germany. You can check it out in 2016—golden ticket not required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cover image courtesy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Warner Bros; story image courtesy &lt;a href="http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/mediaplayer/video-271.html"&gt;ThyssenKrupp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

        <summary type="html">Four tips from CEO Ruzwana Bashir and VC Aileen Lee on raising capital&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fortune.com&amp;amp;blog=64089429&amp;amp;post=890206&amp;amp;subd=fortunedotcom&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's an old saying that ideas are ten a penny, but turning an idea into a company is a different matter all together. At Fortune's Most Powerful Women Next Generation Summit, venture capitalist Aileen Lee and Ruzwana Bashir, founder and CEO of travel site Peek.com unpacked their tips for raising capital, which they say is still a stumbling block for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee is the founder of investing firm Cowboy Ventures, as well as a strategic advisor for Kleiner Perkins. Bashir's company boasts Google's &lt;span data-symbol="GOOG"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fortune.com/company/goog/"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;GOOG&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; Eric Schmidt and Jack Dorsey of Square among its investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee explained that today's investing world has changed from 15 years ago where most start-up teams were made up of Ph.D.s and industry veterans. Today, thanks to coding crash courses like Khan Academy, almost anyone can design an app. &amp;quot;It's exciting,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;but also much more competitive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these strides, women entrepreneurs are still rare. Lee lead a study to find out what makes a a company a billion dollar hit. Of the 13 she listed, which include the likes of Facebook &lt;span data-symbol="FB"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fortune.com/company/fb/"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;, none were led by women. However, she said, things are changing: the next list has a few women on the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are Bashir and Lee's takeaways on raising capital:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build relationships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are gun shy. Get one name and everyone else wants to join. I had experience working at company that raised capital, those existing relationships gave me an in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ruzwana Bashir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hustle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors look for hustle. It's about, “Does the CEO have the ability to make things happen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Aileen Lee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s helpful to have a co-founder with a tech background, but we look to back teams where there’s a combination of skills, instead of having everything in one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Aileen Lee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women tend to be more modest about what they're claiming. VCs then compare them to male entrepreneurs who aren't as cautious about what they are willing to say. There's a confidence delta, and people think it means a difference in skills. As women we need to be extra assertive, more aggressive than we would otherwise be. The vision we have to paint is not just hundreds of millions but billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ruzwana Bashir&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take a &lt;a href="http://www.factor-tech.com/factor-magazine-7.html?wv=s%2FFactor%2520Magazine%2F9233cb01-8a4f-5e5d-92fa-df35e84dfd00%2Ffactor%25201412%2Finfographic.html"&gt;retrospective look at cult-classic Back to The Future II&lt;/a&gt; and see if the technology it predicted for 2015 has become a reality. From the infamous hoverboard to the lesser remembered gadgets in the 1989 movie, we explore what has broken through into everyday life and what still remains a pipedream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing things back up to speed, we look at the &lt;a href="http://www.factor-tech.com/factor-magazine-7.html?wv=s%2FFactor%2520Magazine%2F9233cb01-8a4f-5e5d-92fa-df35e84dfd00%2Ffactor%25201412%2Ftopten.html"&gt;most likely uses for drones&lt;/a&gt;, including a group in France who race their drones in the local forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear from &lt;a href="http://www.factor-tech.com/factor-magazine-7.html?wv=s%2FFactor%2520Magazine%2F9233cb01-8a4f-5e5d-92fa-df35e84dfd00%2Ffactor%25201412%2Fpredictions.html"&gt;futurists and academics about the energy revolution, fake reality, self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt; and all the biggest trends that are going to develop throughout 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also speak to &lt;a href="http://www.factor-tech.com/factor-magazine-7.html?wv=s%2FFactor%2520Magazine%2F9233cb01-8a4f-5e5d-92fa-df35e84dfd00%2Ffactor%25201412%2Fimplant.html"&gt;technologist Amal Graafstra, who has two microchips implanted into his hands&lt;/a&gt;, about body hacking and the advantages it can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as this we see how &lt;a href="http://www.factor-tech.com/factor-magazine-7.html?wv=s%2FFactor%2520Magazine%2F9233cb01-8a4f-5e5d-92fa-df35e84dfd00%2Ffactor%25201412%2Fcannabisvideo.html"&gt;cannabis is now set to go global with the first worldwide brand.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality has been predicted as one of the biggest potential growth areas for 2015, which was cemented with Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR earlier in 2014. We look at how &lt;a href="http://www.factor-tech.com/factor-magazine-7.html?wv=s%2FFactor%2520Magazine%2F9233cb01-8a4f-5e5d-92fa-df35e84dfd00%2Ffactor%25201412%2Fvr.html"&gt;VR will become king in the coming year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate how he will be pioneering by living through someone else, and ask if there are any lasting implications of an immersive VR world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discover how&lt;a href="http://www.factor-tech.com/factor-magazine-7.html?wv=s%2FFactor%2520Magazine%2F9233cb01-8a4f-5e5d-92fa-df35e84dfd00%2Ffactor%25201412%2Falgae.html"&gt; powerful the slippery organism algae can be,&lt;/a&gt; and look at how the &lt;a href="http://www.factor-tech.com/factor-magazine-7.html?wv=s%2FFactor%2520Magazine%2F9233cb01-8a4f-5e5d-92fa-df35e84dfd00%2Ffactor%25201412%2Fnormal.html"&gt;technologies that are now breaking through can quickly become normal&lt;/a&gt; and boring as we adapt to their use.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="html">How Microsoft Lost Hollywood</title>
        <published>2014-12-04T10:19:27Z</published>
        <updated>2014-12-04T10:47:31Z</updated>
        <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.theinformation.com/How-Microsoft-Lost-Hollywood" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer spent more than a year luring his friend Nancy Tellem to Microsoft to head up a new division that would deliver original television shows to Xbox users. Before she officially committed in September 2012, the one-time president of CBS wanted to be sure the software giant in Redmond, Wash. was serious about Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ballmer repeatedly insisted to her that the company was promising hundreds of millions of dollars in investments. In fact, Xbox Entertainment Studios, as the new original content division would be called, was going to be a pillar of the November 2013 release of Xbox One, which Microsoft was pitching less as a gaming device and more as an all encompassing entertainment hub. It would go head-to-head with subscription services like Netflix by offering some free and some paid premium original content to Xbox users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the hopes never amounted to much. The effort was stymied by a rigid corporate structure and culture at Microsoft that was ill-prepared to take on the demands of a content studio, according to interviews with people involved in the effort. By the time the unit began winding down in July, nearly two years after it launched, it had released only one show for Xbox users: a reality series about street soccer timed to coincide with the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the initiative was a victim of cost-cutting and a new CEO with a new agenda. But its struggles along the way show how hard it is for tech companies to break into financing and creating content, even with gobs of cash. It’s also a cautionary tale about the consequences of branching out beyond a core business. (This article is the third in an The Information series on the deep divide between the technology and media industries. Here are parts &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/A-Song-of-Carrier-and-Content"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/An-Uneasy-Union-When-Disney-Met-Maker"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <published>2014-12-04T10:00:57Z</published>

        <summary type="html">&lt;img height="382" alt="online-shopping-cyber-monday" width="595" src="http://d1435t697bgi2o.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/online-shopping-cyber-monday-595x382.jpg"&gt;Even Black Friday sales are falling as more people shift their retail habits to online. Physical stores still have advantages, but we’re quickly finding ways to replace them with virtual substitutes.</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;img height="382" alt="online-shopping-cyber-monday" width="595" src="http://d1435t697bgi2o.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/online-shopping-cyber-monday-595x382.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first shopping I ever really did was online. My formative memories of purchasing things for myself don’t come from toy stores or big-box retailers. Music stores barely figure, and then only in the form of the Borders CD section (may it rest in peace, along with its bookshelves). Instead, I remember long stretches of careful consideration and then sudden dopamine rushes from pushing the big buy button on websites like Amazon, Best Buy, or even Circuit City (also now deceased), then waiting the requisite weeks for packages to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as long as I’ve made my own semi-independent financial decisions, online shopping wasn’t just for Cyber Monday, the Internet offspring of Black Friday that passed early this week, but every day. This year’s Cyber Monday netted over $2 billion, a higher benchmark than ever before and a 17 percent growth over last year, according to the digital analytics company comScore. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://Walmart.com"&gt;Walmart.com&lt;/a&gt; reported it had the most online orders in its history on Monday, with mobile shopping—something I haven’t quite graduated to—making up 70 percent of the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;As shopping, like so many other interactions, moves online, we’re developing services that map better to consumers’ actual desires.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m clearly not alone in my commitment to buying online. In fact, as Cyber Monday sales have grown, Black Friday sales are actually falling. Total purchases on the more traditional shopping holiday decreased by 11 percent this year, reports the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/business/thanksgiving-weekend-sales-at-stores-and-online-slide-11-percent.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The 133.7 million people who showed up to shop early that morning was 5.2 percent fewer than 2013, and the $380.95 they spent on average represented a 6.4 percent decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that more retail is moving online. The entire shopping experience, particularly around the end-of-year holidays, is becoming more diffuse. Black Friday is stretching out into “Black November,” a new coinage that subsumes online shopping and regular retail into one month of commercial bacchanalia. But what might look like a signal that American culture is finally disappearing into its own consumption habits (how long until Thanksgiving is just renamed Dark Thursday?) is really just representative of how traditional retail as a whole is failing consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHYSICAL STORES HAVE PLENTY&lt;/strong&gt; of advantages. Customers are actually able to see and touch the products they’re considering before they buy, avoiding possible disappointment and a lengthy return process. Theoretically, store clerks are there to answer questions and make educated recommendations. Still, we’re increasingly trading the trip to a store for a single click online. It’s more convenient, of course, but I think that gives short shrift to online shopping’s actual benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying online has become a much richer experience than shopping IRL. On the Internet, we already have experts we trust. Reviews are available beneath every product, whether it’s a popular book or an obscure vitamin supplement. Through social media, we’ve made a consumer-driven community around buying that simply wasn’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was searching for the perfect pair of headphones or computer speakers as a kid, I knew I could wander onto forum sites to ask for specific advice. I remember posting on a music message board once to inquire which beginner’s bass guitar I might buy for my brother one Christmas and getting an informed answer almost instantly. The venerable CNET website was there to direct me toward just which mp3 players to consider, with their huge 64 megabytes of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ecosystem has evolved considerably today. My favorite recent wrinkle in online shopping is the boom in affiliate marketing and referral sites, which direct users toward specific products and then receive a cut of the price if a visitor goes on to buy the product on a retail platform like Amazon. The practice can be sketchy—the businesses do have a stake in pushing you to buy the most expensive items, and as fast as possible, before their referral time runs out. But if you know where to go, these sites will provide better buying context than any store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://thewirecutter.com/"&gt;The Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;, founded by gadget expert Brian Lam, carries out extensive testing to let readers know exactly which umbrella, laptop, or television to buy. Its sister-site &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://thesweethome.com/"&gt;The Sweethome&lt;/a&gt; does the same for home goods like towels, pillows, and ice trays. The proof is all in the process—writers explain just what experiments they carried out to determine which version holds up. It’s less about reviews than it is about proof, and the results are wholly convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://thenightlight.com/"&gt;The Nightlight&lt;/a&gt; takes a similar approach, but focuses specifically on baby products, doing the kind of safety evaluation that will calm new parents’ fears. Slate even launched its own affiliate marketing website with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://picks.slate.com/?wpsrc=picks_all_email_holiday_dedicated"&gt;Slate Picks&lt;/a&gt;, where readers can buy further in to the site’s brand and follow its tastemakers. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://food52.com/provisions"&gt;Food52&lt;/a&gt; hosts the equivalent of a minimalist comestibles store online, where it sells everything from Japanese spice mixes to ravioli rolling pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shopping, like so many other interactions, moves online, we’re developing services that map better to consumers’ actual desires, creating a decentralized ecosystem that allows for more, better marketing, and more positive shopping experiences than waiting in line outside in the cold on one November morning. It’s a great step for consumers and retailers alike—that is, if they can keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon landed in fourth place with its new Fire TV, which captures 10% of the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google’s Chromecast streaming stick is much cheaper than competing devices, which could be part of the reason it’s become so popular over the past several months. But, since it’s less expensive, its functionality is also more limited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chromecast" src="http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52015614eab8ea3f15000020-960-537/screen%20shot%202013-08-06%20at%204.00.36%20pm.png" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The $35 Chromecast is a small USB stick that plugs into the HDMI port on your TV. It’s currently on sale for &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Google-Chromecast-Streaming-Media-Player/dp/B00DR0PDNE/&amp;amp;ref_=tv_srch_google"&gt;$23 via Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Apple TV and Amazon’s Fire TV, by comparison, both cost $90, while the Roku Stick costs $50 and the Roku 3 costs $99.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Apple TV" src="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/547f3cb5ecad045a1b002b3b-901-675/apple-tv-5.png" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chromecast connects to your iPhone, Android phone, iPad, Android tablet, or laptop (Windows or Mac), and lets you “cast” apps to your TV. It works with popular services such as YouTube, Netflix, HBO GO, and Hulu Plus among others. You can also mirror content from your Android device or Chrome browser directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Roku 3" src="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/538e055169beddb00c859eed-1200-706/719ceumoxml._sl1500_.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main difference between the Chromecast and its competitors is that you &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;a separate device to watch content and run apps, while other offerings from Amazon, Roku, and Apple don’t. Still, if you want to watch Netflix or Hulu on your TV but don’t want to invest more than $50 in a streaming device, the Chromecast seems like it can get the job done well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This story originally appeared on &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-chromecast-beats-apple-tv-2014-12"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://venturebeat.feedsportal.com/c/34021/f/617399/s/4119c5df/sc/28/mf.gif" border="0"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/a2.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/214612378094/u/49/f/617399/c/34021/s/4119c5df/sc/28/a2t.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

        <title type="html">The secret lives of consumers revealed, in GIFs</title>

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, we took a glimpse into Neustar’s vast data maw and, in doing so, looked directly into consumers’ souls. Well, nearly.&lt;br&gt;
Here's what we found, illustrated. Sponsor content by Neustar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://digiday.com/sponsored/neustarbcs-the-secret-lives-of-consumers-revealed-by-data-in-gifs/"&gt;The secret lives of consumers revealed, in GIFs&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://digiday.com"&gt;Digiday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, we took a glimpse into &lt;a href="http://www.neustar.biz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neustar&lt;/span&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; vast data maw and, in doing so, looked directly into consumers’ souls. Well, nearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Everyone knows that the digital 1s and 0s at a marketer’s disposal is almost infinite. The problem isn’t getting enough data, it’s getting the right insights from that data. One way to do that is to overlap different data sets to pinpoint true marketing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We did just that. Here’s what we found, illustrated in handy Venn Diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life in the HOV lane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe height="500" width="500" src="http://gfycat.com/ifr/HandsomeInferiorBanteng"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who they are:&lt;/strong&gt; Neustar’s consumer data showed that these body-conscious, type-A have-it-all’ers are, among other things, big Diet Coke drinkers: they roll large in luxury SUVs — preferring the Mercedes G-Class, Lexus Gx 470 and the BMW X5, — and clean out retailers like Ann Taylor, Brooks Brothers and Babies”R”Us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it means:&lt;/strong&gt; These are affluent people with little time for your brand message; they fast-forward through your television ads. In fact, our data shows these consumers are likely to leave the room during ads. Don’t try to sell them on Diet Coke in 30 second prime-time spots. Instead, brands should reach them with video ads at the gym or with direct and to-the-point search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tosh.0 is my spirit animal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe height="500" width="500" src="http://gfycat.com/ifr/GoldenMajesticFalcon"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who they are:&lt;/strong&gt;  In addition to snowboarding, these extreme sportsbros love Atlantic City, hip-hop and fantasy football. And they’re probably managing their lives on at least one mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it means:&lt;/strong&gt; This group spends fast and early on technology: they buy new technology without hesitation and lead their friends in the gadget race. Forget Mountain Dew — it’s Samsung that should be handing out free swag at the X-Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smackdowns in the suburbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe height="500" width="500" src="http://gfycat.com/ifr/ParallelImpoliteHairstreak"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who they are:&lt;/strong&gt; These occasional yogis and devout recyclers — 20 percent higher than others, on average — are also in charge of the household shopping. And, they’re most likely to whip out their American Express card when picking up the toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it means:&lt;/strong&gt; Curiously, at the intersection of this very practical trifecta sits an unlikely warrior: peek under the Lululemon hoodie, and you’ll find a TV viewer who enjoys blood sports like boxing and the full-throttle pace of the NBA post-season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kleenex is tops with this set – and targeting these athletic women with messaging that moves beyond the usually touchy-feely or fashion-forward is a sure bet. After all, Kleenex is good for nosebleeds, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Couch parents seek escape plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe height="500" width="500" src="http://gfycat.com/ifr/SoulfulPopularBongo"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who they are:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Not every couch potato is a lazy ne’er do well. Some, like those sitting at this demographic intersection, are just new parents. Neustar data shows that Netflix power-watchers are more likely to have had a baby in the last 12 months (or have one on the way). Without much time for themselves, they subsist on quick-fix meals and take-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it means:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s no surprise that these power-watchers are second-screening during &lt;em&gt;Archer &lt;/em&gt;marathons. Often on the New York Times website, clearly these consumers are thirsty for more than just baby formula spots and Pampers ads. When the kid’s finally asleep, they’re also surfing Movietickets.com, TripAdvisor.com and JetBlue.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many years ‘til that kid leaves for college?&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg2-tue-Yow&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like ‘em or lump ‘em, you should give ‘em credit—Dave Grohl’s Foo Fighters have kind of redefined the concept album with their latest, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1vOTq02"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic Highways&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; pushing a tired form in a refreshing direction. Rather than a self-contained narrative, the record opens itself up to tell the stories of rock ‘n’ roll itself or, as &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/sonic-highways-mw0002720414"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allmusic&lt;/em&gt; puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “the classic rock that unites the U.S. from coast to coast.” Picking up where his celebratory film &lt;a href="http://buy.soundcitymovie.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sound City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; left off, Grohl ties in his newest release with a &lt;a href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/11/dave-grohl-reveals-kurt-cobains-reaction-to-early-foo-fighters-demo/"&gt;series of HBO documentaries&lt;/a&gt; that visit cities from New York, to Nashville, Austin, New Orleans, L.A., Washington, DC., and Seattle to tell their musical stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKe59su7mSk&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the musical history of that last metropolis cannot be narrated without reference to Grohl’s former band, and so, &lt;a href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/11/dave-grohl-reveals-kurt-cobains-reaction-to-early-foo-fighters-demo/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consequence of Sound&lt;/em&gt; informs us&lt;/a&gt;, “Nirvana received heavy focus during the [Seattle &lt;em&gt;Sonic Highways&lt;/em&gt;] episode as Dave Grohl recounted his time in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame outfit. Among the biggest revelations was the time Kurt Cobain asked to hear solo recordings Grohl had been working on during Nirvana’s 1992 tour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Kurt heard that, and kissed me on the face, as he was in a bath,” Grohl revealed. “He was so excited. He was like, ‘I heard you recorded some stuff with Barrett [Jones].’ I was like, ‘Yeah.’ He was like, ‘Let me hear it.’ I was too afraid to be in the same room as he listened to it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Grohl intended these early Foo Fighters recordings as an anonymous side project, but the demos garnered enough attention that he later [after Cobain’s death] formed a band and, well… we pretty much know the rest of that story, tragedy and all. But as for the demos, we can hear them too, just as Cobain did, possibly while in the bath, in ‘92. These early versions of songs like “Alone + Easy Target” (top), “Big Me” (above), and “Exhausted” (below)—all of which eventually made their way onto the &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/foo-fighters-mw0000177195"&gt;first, eponymous 1995 Foo Fighters album&lt;/a&gt;—have been collected as an unofficial release called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ioffer.com/i/nirvana-dave-s-demotapes-1992-1993-foo-fighters-162539685"&gt;Nirvana: Dave’s Demotapes 1992-1993&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKyCv2VZW2w&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grohl plays all the instruments on these recordings (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKyCv2VZW2w&amp;amp;list=RDGKyCv2VZW2w#t=0"&gt;hear more here&lt;/a&gt;), and wrote all the lyrics, though, as he tells us in an interview below, writing lyrics isn’t something he enjoys. He also discusses his admiration for Cobain’s natural writing ability, and reveals that the Nirvana frontman liked “Exhausted” and “Alone + Easy Target” so much he wanted to turn them into Nirvana songs. The opportunity was lost, but Cobain’s encouragement clearly had positive effect on the future Foo Fighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbTvypAUjnw&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a rock frontman—and a current storyteller of rock history—may have been an evolutionary leap for Grohl, but drumming has been a constant before, during, and after the Nirvana phenomenon. As a denizen of the DC punk scene, Grohl lived part of the rock history of that city as well, playing with several hardcore bands, including Dain Bramage, the project that followed his first band, Mission Impossible. Music blog &lt;em&gt;Antiquiet&lt;/em&gt; brings us that band’s &lt;a href="http://antiquiet.com/retro/2014/01/for-the-collectors-and-historians-heres-a-rare-demo-tape-from-dave-grohls-childhood-band-dain-bramage/"&gt;1986 demo recordings&lt;/a&gt;. They’re well worth a listen, showcasing a classic mid-80s DC sound, backed by what was even then some profoundly excellent drumming from Grohl. As Dain Bramage’s singer remarked, “After you’ve spent a couple years with Dave Grohl as your drummer it’s easy to feel like no other drummer exists.” The charismatic but humble Grohl writes some pretty decent songs too, even while working in the shadow of superfamous Kurt Cobain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s tip is an excerpt from Social Fresh’s &lt;a href="http://www.socialfreshacademy.com/courses/content-marketing-prototype"&gt;Content Marketing Template.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever heard me talk about content marketing, you know that I am a big believer in spending MORE time on FEWER pieces of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call it the &lt;a href="http://socialfresh.com/the-vanilla-ice-rule-content-marketing/"&gt;Vanilla Ice rule&lt;/a&gt;: Creating one big hit that you can remix, reuse, and reimagine for months if not years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to creating high-quality, long-form content is simply investing more time. For example, if you have 10 hours per week to invest, reserve the majority of that time, 80 percent, for your long-form content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to creating a big piece of content, you’ll want to invest at least 60 hours researching, crafting, and promoting the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breaking Down The 60 Hours&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60 hours is a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent more than 60 hours on certain blog &lt;a href="http://socialfresh.com/facebook-advertising-examples/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;. Many businesses end up skipping long-form, high-quality content when they start producing posts for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and maybe a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes business are just filling up the space. When you skip long-form content, you are missing out on your most strategic content opportunity. Long-from content creates valuable returns for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 60 hours, you can create a strategic and high quality piece of content that will perform for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to invest your time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="421" alt="60 hour contnet" width="640" src="http://socialfresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/60-hour-contnet-640x421.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-thirds of that time, or at least 40 hours, should be spent on creating (10 hours on research and 30 hours on crafting the content).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are interviewing experts, writing blog posts, or shooting video — invest at least 40 hours crafting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final third of your time, 20 hours, should be spent promoting and distributing your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t spend 60+ hours on a single piece of content without a promotion plan. And quality promotion takes time. Your promotion includes SEO work, guest posts, repurposing the content into other formats, publishing excerpts to social networks, paid promotion, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What Topic Should 60-Hour Content Cover?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your 60-hour content, you want to answer customer questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick the topic that relates to the broadest section of your customer base, or the most lucrative subset of your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also want to make sure that the topic has a strategic tie back to your content business goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want relevance, both to the pain points of your customer and to your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What Is The Best Format For 60-Hour Content?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quick ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ebook (25 pages or more)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long form blog post (list or “complete guide”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference or other live event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online training course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webinar series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio series (or podcast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infographic(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to realize that whichever format you choose, it is just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content can be reshaped into other formats over the long term. Choose the format that 1)  your customers will respond to and 2) you are most comfortable creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about finally signing up for Spotify Premium? There couldn’t be a better time to do it. For a limited time only, Spotify is offering new customers three months of access for just $0.99 a month — that’s $9 off its normal price.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you spend more than $10 a month on music, then find that after a few weeks, you’re bored of all the songs you’ve purchased? Then you need a music streaming subscription. With Spotify, you can get access to a catalog of more than 20 million songs, which you can enjoy whenever, wherever, as much as you like. And with the Spotify app on your mobile device, you can save your favorite tracks locally for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify is usually priced at $9.99 a month, and even at that, it’s well worth it. But until December 31, new users in the U.S. and the U.K. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/holiday/?utm_source=Spotify_House&amp;amp;utm_medium=audio&amp;amp;utm_term=en-us_audio_en-us_audiotrial.happy15sec&amp;amp;utm_content=US500954&amp;amp;utm_campaign=q4.14_premium_holiday_us&amp;amp;oauth_token=NApgCkgKDVNwb3RpZnktdXNlcnMSCWpvc2h1YWMzNxoDmAEBJYWRf1QyIgoI9xFB1b0BfpMSFkd0lHiWFA4g1TwjCYTny3Nw3C2RiG0SFOwS_sUmiP_y--HnJ8MqwYSgVxmV"&gt;will pay just $0.99 &lt;/a&gt;(£0.99) a month for the first three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, if you wish to continue using the service — and you probably will — the price goes back up to $9.99 (£9.99), or $4.99 if you’re a student with a .edu email address. There is one caveat, though, and it’s a big one: This offer is only available to brand new subscribers who haven’t paid for Spotify Premium in the past or taken advantage of a free trial.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">How a lanky kid from South Dakota became the trusted confidant of LeBron James and Tracy McGrady — and seemingly everybody else in the NBA.&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&amp;amp;blog=60203239&amp;amp;post=196121&amp;amp;subd=espngrantland&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hen the Orlando Magic traded Mike Miller in 2003, Tracy McGrady’s constant complaining about the deal irritated coach Doc Rivers. Miller had been McGrady’s best friend on the team — and one of his best friends in general — when Orlando made Miller the centerpiece of a deal with Memphis for then-rookies Drew Gooden and Gordan Giricek. McGrady and Miller had been inseparable as Magic teammates and had lived near one another in Florida. “We are good friends off the court,” McGrady &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://hoopshype.com/interviews/mcgrady_tuck.htm"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; an Orlando radio station in 2002. “I call Mike my little white brother. They trade Mike Miller, I’m retiring. Simple as that.” McGrady did not retire, but he stewed so much after the deal that Rivers initially worried whether his franchise player would ever move on. Then, McGrady erupted for 52 points in his first game without Miller. “I asked T-Mac if he had any more friends,” Rivers joked to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-02-22/sports/0302220477_1_mcgrady-mike-miller-magic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orlando Sentinel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “If so, we’re going to trade them all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, Miller is no longer the slashing playmaker of his NBA youth. He’s now the smooth-shooting veteran on the revamped Cleveland Cavaliers. It’s a role he’s seemingly been preparing for his entire career: to be there at the right moment for the right shot or the right words. Wherever Miller has played, he has been a friend to the stars — and the scrubs, executives, coaches, and everyone in between. “He has the unique experience of playing in every situation,” said James Jones, a fellow Heat-to-Cavaliers transplant. “He’s been on rebuilding teams. He’s been on championship teams. He’s been on contending teams. He’s been a starter. He’s been the sixth man. He’s been out of the rotation. He’s been injured. He’s bounced back and came back. Every player in this league can relate to him on some level. That’s tough to find because you find that a lot of guys spend most of their time on the extremes. They’re either major rotation guys [who] get a lot of opportunities or they’re fringe guys that are grinding every day to maintain a position in the league.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Miller’s three years in Miami, his role would often change over the course of a season, going from seldom-used reserve in the regular season to major contributor in the playoffs. Miller rained so many 3-pointers in the 2012 and 2013 NBA Finals that LeBron James was upset when Miami decided to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2014-09-30/cavaliers-heat-lebron-james-mike-miller-amnesty-waive-release"&gt;amnesty Miller&lt;/a&gt; after the 2013 championship to save &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/18239/waiving-mike-miller-a-must-for-miami"&gt;$17 million in luxury tax payments&lt;/a&gt;. When James signed in Cleveland, he asked Miller to join him on the Cavaliers. “You can put him in the starting lineup, he’s ready to go,” James said of Miller. “You can bring him off the bench, he’s ready to go. In Miami, there were times when he didn’t play at all and he was ready to go, and you got to have guys like that on the roster in order to win. You got to have guys that don’t care about ‘me’ — it’s about the team. And that’s what he’s all about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller’s range extends well beyond the 3-point line. He can be the glue that binds a championship team, thanks in part to lessons he learned over a decade of trying to break through in the NBA playoffs. There’s a reason why Kyrie Irving chose Miller to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyYU18ZBo7o"&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt; if the second game of this season was “similar to what a playoff game feels like.” It’s why last season with the Grizzlies, Nick Calathes spent almost as much time at Miller’s home as at his own. And it’s why, years earlier, Kyle Lowry did the same during the beginning of his NBA career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s a chameleon &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; meaning he can fit in any different room,” said LeBron James’s longtime friend and business manager Maverick Carter, whose relationship with Miller began shortly after Miller and McGrady attended one of James’s high school games. “I’ve seen him with high-level businesspeople and owners, kids, people from all different backgrounds. A guy from South Dakota, he’s not from one of the coasts, he’s right in the middle of the country and I think he really can adapt to any room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Plus he’s a cool guy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; little more than four years ago, when legions of reporters descended on Boston for Miami’s first regular-season shootaround with James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, Miller was shocked by how much attention the Heat attracted from media and fans. It took time to adjust to how the public digested and dissected every moment of every Heat game, how any minor mix-up could spiral into a viral crisis. But not this time around. In Cleveland, slightly before this season began, Miller said he knew what he would be getting into, and he looked forward to helping his new teammates adjust to playing under the NBA’s brightest spotlight. As a Cav, alongside young All-Stars Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, Miller recognized that a large part of his job this season would be imparting NBA life lessons and preparing the team’s playoff virgins for the goal of a deep postseason run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I do is, I understand people,” Miller explained. “I understand what they’re going through. For some reason, I’m always in a good mood. It’s a blessing for me. I understand it’s a team sport and if there’s going to be individuals inside it, how do I relate to every one of those players differently? The way I do stuff with LeBron during a game is completely different than what I’m going to do with Kyrie [Irving]. Some people need to talk. Some people need to laugh. I’m always in that good mood because at the end of the day, I’m [playing basketball] for a living.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It’s a role that Miller has seemingly been preparing for his entire career: to be there at the right moment for the right shot or the right words. Wherever Miller has played, he has been a friend to the stars — and the scrubs, executives, coaches, and everyone in between.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Miami, he learned that part of keeping his teammates happy meant always being ready to contribute, even when he was playing only a handful of minutes per game. “Every time LeBron or D-Wade or Chris Bosh passed you the ball — no different this year — they’re going to expect me to make it,” Miller said. “When I was in Memphis, I’d shoot 14, 15, 16 times a game. I had to get used to being in Miami, where I would shoot three or four shots a game, but they’d expect me to make every one of them. Mentally, you had to get better at that. The whole reason I came there is I wanted to test myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, joining Miami and the Big Three’s multi-championship quest represented one of the final steps in Miller’s NBA journey. Before he landed as a clutch playoff marksman in Miami, Miller’s career had been a 10-year odyssey in which he experienced almost everything the league can throw at a player, from lottery finishes to playoff runs and from individual accolades to debilitating injuries. The only thing that Miller hadn’t done was play for an NBA championship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="miller-mike-mcgrady-tracy-orlando-magic" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/millermagic.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he Magic selected Miller out of Florida with the fifth pick in the 2000 draft. He entered the NBA as a scorer, a 6-foot-8 wing who could put the ball on the floor and get to the rim. “I didn’t know you were a shooter,” Grant Hill once told Miller after a particularly impressive shooting display in practice. At the time, Orlando believed it had a dynasty in the making. In the four years since Shaquille O’Neal left to sign with the Lakers, the Magic opened enough salary-cap space to sign three premier free agents. They focused on McGrady, Hill, and Tim Duncan. Duncan chose to stay in San Antonio, but the Magic landed McGrady and Hill and looked forward to a bright union between two of the league’s best young wing players. Instead, Hill was plagued by ankle injuries that kept him out of the lineup for long stretches, year after year. Miller, who was drafted the same year that Orlando signed Hill, was forced to play early and often in his absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Miller beat out top overall pick Kenyon Martin for the league’s rookie of the year award. Miller averaged 11.9 points and connected on 41 percent of his 3-pointers while filling in ably for Hill, who played only four games that season. “There was a lot of pressure put on him that he didn’t know he’d have,” Rivers told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/nba/magic/2001-05-09-miller.htm"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “When you know all summer that you’re going to have to carry a team, you prepare for that. Mike was like a kid at camp thinking he’d get taught by the counselors. But the next thing he knew, he was the one teaching the camp. That made things difficult for him, but he handled it all really well.” Orlando made the playoffs, but the Magic lost 3-1 to Milwaukee in the first round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his first few years in the league, Miller talked to veteran teammates like Darrell Armstrong, Bo Outlaw, Patrick Ewing, and Horace Grant about what it took to have staying power in the NBA. Miller knew that most players who make it to the league don’t last longer than a handful of years, and he was determined to not become one of them. “You’ve got to master one craft or you’ve got to be really, really good at everything,” Miller said. “And I felt like my best chance was to lock the gym door, shoot ’em up, and give myself an opportunity to be around for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To McGrady’s dismay, Orlando embarked on a mini-rebuilding project in 2003 when the franchise traded Miller to Memphis. Miller could score and shoot, but the Magic were concerned that he had been inconsistent. Memphis, on the other hand, coveted Miller’s all-around game. “We were looking for a guy that would be a 3-point shooter, but more important, a guy that could handle the ball and be in the middle of the break because we were always fast breaking, and he was perfect,” said Hubie Brown, who coached the Grizzlies from 2002 to 2005. “He’s one of my favorite players and it’s because he’s a total professional and he has a high IQ for the game and he can play multiple positions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“There was this kid from South Dakota that was rebounding, bringing the ball up the floor, shooting 3s, posting up, making passes, making plays. I had never seen a white guy play like that.” &lt;span&gt;—Udonis Haslem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those years, the Grizzlies were transforming from a hapless franchise that had never had a winning record into a Western Conference playoff team. Miller became one of the premier scorers on a talented young roster with teammates like Jason Williams, Shane Battier, and Pau Gasol, but despite fielding five players who would go on to win NBA championships with other teams, the mid-2000s Grizzlies never made it past the first round. “Little did I know it took a lot more than [talent],” Miller said. Those Memphis teams were swept from the playoffs in three consecutive years: 2004, 2005, and 2006, the year that Miller was named the NBA’s sixth man of the year. That summer, Memphis drafted Kyle Lowry out of Villanova, and Miller helped the young point guard adjust to professional basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was living by myself,” Lowry said. “I was all alone. He knew I lived out near him and Mike basically gave me the passcode to the gate to his house. [He] let me go in his gym, his wife would make dinner, and I would eat dinner like I was one of the family. He just accepted me for everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowry, like Miller and many other Grizzlies of that era, has since become a key contributor for one of the better teams in the league. But none of them experienced that success in Memphis, and by the summer of 2008, after two straight 22-60 seasons, the franchise decided to change direction. A &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/draft2008/news/story?id=3463045"&gt;couple of hours after that year’s draft had ended&lt;/a&gt;, Memphis traded Miller in a multi-player deal centered on Minnesota receiving Miller and the fifth overall pick, Kevin Love, for the third pick, O.J. Mayo. The announcement surprised Miller. His name had been dragged through the rumor mill for years, but the draft seemed to have passed without him changing teams. He thought he was safe, until he received a call while attending his brother’s wedding. “It’s going to be tough to leave,” he told &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/sports/grizzlies/miller-stunned-at-late-trade"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Commercial Appeal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s what makes it the hardest — the relationships I’ve built. You develop relationships inside the organization and in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller spent the next two seasons in NBA lottery-team purgatory. In Minnesota, he was chastised for not shooting enough on a team that lacked players who could score from long range. “There’s times when I sometimes maybe don’t shoot enough, but I’ve always played the way it was supposed to be played &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; or tried to anyways,” Miller said. “Looking back at it, I probably should have shot more. But you play within a system and I’ve always tried not to go outside that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year as a Washington Wizard (he was part of a multi-player deal that allowed Minnesota to draft Ricky Rubio), Miller joined a team that was about to endure one of the worst train-wreck seasons in NBA history. Everything that could go wrong did. After 32 games, Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton were suspended for the rest of the year for possessing guns in the Wizards locker room. “I never in my life would assume that I would be sitting in front of a grand jury an hour and a half before the basketball game,” Miller recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also during the 2009-10 season, Wizards guard DeShawn Stevenson vehemently objected to Miller wearing LeBron James’s signature Nike sneakers, because Stevenson considered James to be a rival. (The Wizards finished 26-56 that year and missed the playoffs, while James’s Cavaliers won 61 games.) “That was on the cover of the paper,” Miller said. “I understood what their problem was, but I didn’t see my shoes making a difference. But I like DeShawn. DeShawn was a great teammate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As rare as it may be to hear Miller say anything bad about a teammate, it may be even harder to find a teammate of Miller’s who would speak ill of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With that team, the guys on that team, not being professionals, joking around all the time, having a guy like Mike made it [so] I felt like I had somebody on my level,” said Antawn Jamison of that lost year in Washington. “I felt like I had somebody who wanted to accomplish the same things that I wanted to, and it makes the season doable because Mike was somebody who I could talk to. He was somebody I could express my frustrations with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days, Jamison tried to take Miller’s lead. He told himself that no matter how frustrated he got with his teammates, he would be like Miller and keep his smile. But Jamison couldn’t always manage it. He could never quite figure out how Miller stayed cheerful during one of the gloomiest, most dysfunctional NBA seasons of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Miller, a cheerful demeanor has always been a key to success and a way to find acceptance with teammates and coaches. “As a kid from South Dakota growing up, trying to make it,” Miller said, “I had to find ways to fit in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="miller-mike-cleveland-cavaliers-nakapameywang" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/millercavs2.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gene Sweeney Jr./Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;oy or girl, you really didn’t have a choice of whether you played basketball in the Miller family. “Basically, in our family, they put a ball in your hands the day you were born,” said Ryan Miller, one of Mike’s two older brothers. The Millers are a South Dakota basketball dynasty. Mike’s father, Tom, and his two younger brothers all starred at Dakota Wesleyan University, where Mike’s uncle Alan ended his career as the state’s all-time leading scorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My family, we shot,” Mike Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Dakota is anything but a basketball hotbed. The only NBA players it has produced besides Mike Miller are &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/piatker01.html"&gt;Eric Piatkowski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/reineja01.html"&gt;Jared Reiner&lt;/a&gt;. But the state, especially Miller’s hometown of Mitchell, possesses an affinity for the sport. Gary Munsen, coach of the Mitchell High School Kernels, is the patriarch of the town’s basketball culture. He was hired in 1973 and walked the sideline at the Corn Palace — an arena and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Palace"&gt;tourist destination&lt;/a&gt; whose façade is covered with murals made of corn — for almost four decades, until he retired in 2012. Munsen put Mike Miller on his varsity team beginning in Miller’s freshman year, but the coach didn’t need the rail-thin teenager at first because Ryan and Jared Miller were already stars for the Kernels. When Jared missed a game with an injury during Mike’s sophomore year, Munsen gave the minutes to Mike, who responded by scoring 36 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He could play point,” Munsen recalled. “He could play off guard and then I could put him at center. We just kind of moved him all over. He was such a good kid that he didn’t care. It was all about team basketball.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Millers may have been basketball royalty within South Dakota, but it took a concerted effort to gain exposure on the national scene, where the state was viewed as a hoops backwater. Mike played AAU ball for Paul Seville’s Dakota Schoolers, driving as far as Las Vegas and Los Angeles to compete against elite talent from all over the country. “Back in the pre-Internet days, it was very difficult,” Seville said. “You didn’t have websites. You had scouts out there like Bob Gibbons and Clark Francis. They’d seen [Miller] play, but there weren’t as many people out there. There weren’t blogs. There were rankings, but you got them once a month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teddy Dupay recalled watching Miller for the first time at a tournament in Las Vegas a few years before they became teammates at Florida. Miller was only about 6-foot-1, but Dupay remembered thinking, &lt;em&gt;Man, this kid can really play&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next summer, Dupay attended the same tournament, where he ran into Florida assistant coach John Pelphrey. Dupay had already committed to the Gators, and Pelphrey was there to scout Miller. He motioned to Miller, and Dupay barely recognized the player who’d impressed him the previous year. “I didn’t know it was Mike,” Dupay said. “He took a rebound off the glass, made an in-and-out at the top of the key, went coast-to-coast and hit a 3. He was like 6-8.” Udonis Haslem, who also went on to play at Florida, watched the same game. “There was this kid from South Dakota that was rebounding, bringing the ball up the floor, shooting 3s, posting up, making passes, making plays,” Haslem said. &lt;em&gt;This is the next Larry Bird&lt;/em&gt;, Haslem thought. “I had never seen a white guy play like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, Miller was being pursued by a who’s who of college coaches. “He just kind of exploded,” Munsen said. “Billy Donovan was at Florida. Tubby Smith was at Kentucky and Roy Williams was at Kansas at that time. Dr. Tom Davis was at Iowa. Steve Lavin was at UCLA. Denny Crum was still at Louisville. Rick Majerus was at Utah. They were all here, every one of them. The town was buzzing for about three years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller was named the first McDonald’s All American from South Dakota. The team traveled to North Carolina in his senior year for the prestigious Glaxo Wellcome Holiday Invitational, and Miller broke the tournament’s single-game scoring record, previously set by Penny Hardaway, with 54 points. “We knew we were good in our little state of South Dakota, but we hadn’t been challenged on a national level,” said J.J. Kippes, one of Miller’s high school teammates. “So we go down there and there’s a bunch of D-I recruits, [and] that’s when we realized what a special talent he was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida pursued Miller more doggedly than any other school throughout his high school career. Gators coach Billy Donovan’s 1998 recruiting class had been anchored by in-state standouts Dupay and Haslem, and he believed that landing Miller could put the team in contention for a national championship. Donovan visited South Dakota often and practically dispatched Pelphrey to live there. “We went to Vegas and L.A. and they drove behind us the whole way,” Miller said. “I’m telling you, I think some of the NCAA rules have been changed because of that. If we stayed in a Super 8, they stayed in a Super 8. They wanted to be seen every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seville, Miller’s AAU coach, remembered seeing Florida coaches wherever he brought his team: “They didn’t break any rules or anything, but if we went to the mall, they were at the mall. If we went to dinner, they were at dinner. Back in those days, before the NCAA changed the summer rules, the coaches could talk to summer coaches at the events. It was like a wedding reception line at your games. You’d have 30, 40 coaches lined up. It took an hour, hour and a half after the game to get out of the gym.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller and Donovan established a bond. “Every coach keeps telling me how great I am,” Miller remembered telling Donovan. “How they’re going to put the ball in my hands, how they’re going to build their program around me. I don’t want to hear any of that stuff. I want to hear what I’ve got to do to get better.” Donovan said he was direct with Miller about his vision for how Florida would play with him in the lineup and how Miller’s game would develop in Gainesville. “We were almost talking every single day,” Donovan said. “I think it got to the point where he just believed in me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="miller-mike-florida-2" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/millerflorida2.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;AP Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;iller surprised the college basketball world when he committed to Florida. He had chosen a football school over powerhouse programs like Kansas, Kentucky, and UCLA. “When we were able to get Mike to come &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; the McDonald’s All American &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; it was like everybody believed that was the final anchor for that class,” Dupay said. “That made everybody feel like, &lt;em&gt;Yes, we made the right choice. We got a big-time recruit over Kansas&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller averaged 12.2 points in his freshman year, and Florida advanced to the Sweet 16 of the 1999 NCAA tournament, where the Gators lost to Gonzaga. But the most memorable shot of his college career would come the following year, when Butler threatened to upset Florida in the first round of the 2000 tourney. With Florida trailing by one and seconds remaining in overtime, Dupay received an outlet pass and began racing upcourt, intent on scoring. But he slipped near the elbow and lost his balance. “Made a little move, didn’t really have my footing,” Dupay said. “[But] Mike always makes the right play. Had I been on balance, he probably would have moved to the corner, but he saw that it wasn’t right. His feel for the game is so good and he curled right around me. Had he not done that, I would have looked like a real &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; it would have been a terrible thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dupay shoveled the ball to Miller with about 2.5 seconds left. It seemed as if Miller, who was known as a shooter, might just rise for a potential game-winning jumper. But Dupay remembered a moment earlier in the season when Florida had lost to DePaul at the United Center. Miller had played a sparkling second half and had a chance to win the game with a late 3-pointer, but DePaul center Steven Hunter got a finger on the ball and blocked the shot. After the defeat, Donovan told Miller that he would entrust him with the ball late in games. “You’re our best passer, best facilitator,” Donovan remembered saying. “You’ve got size. You can get to the basket. You cannot settle for trying to win games from the 3-point line. You’ve got to put the ball on the floor. You’ve got to get to the lane.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with Florida’s season on the line against Butler, Miller drove to the paint, split two defenders, and lofted a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgb1rh7iKgM"&gt;floater&lt;/a&gt; just before the buzzer. He didn’t even see the shot go in. He crashed to the floor, and before he could glance at the rim, he found himself buried underneath a pile of celebrating Florida teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It changed my life and a lot of lives around us,” Miller said of the Butler game winner. That win breathed life into the Gators, who won their next four games and stormed into the national championship game. Florida’s run included a Sweet 16 upset over a juggernaut Duke squad that featured Shane Battier, Carlos Boozer, Mike Dunleavy Jr., and Jay Williams. “The one thing about us is we were a young, naive team,” Miller said. “We felt like we should be favored in every game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gators lost the final, 89-76, to Michigan State. Still, the foundation for Florida’s future success under Donovan was laid down that year, largely thanks to Miller, Dupay, and Haslem. Miller helped set the path for Florida’s eventual Final Four appearances and back-to-back national championships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his sophomore season, Miller declared for the NBA. “This is another challenge that I think that I’m ready to face,” he said at his announcement. “The challenge is going to be difficult, without question. I think that going into college, I wasn’t prepared to play college basketball. And going into the NBA I don’t think that I’ll be prepared to do that. But there’s one thing that’s certain. I’ll go in there and play 100 percent. I’ll play as hard as I possibly can. Hopefully, the best will come of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="675" alt="miller-mike-miami-heat" width="1200" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/millerheat.jpg?w=1200&amp;amp;h=675"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Isaac Baldizon/NBAE/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;illy Donovan remembered the call he got from Miller in the summer of 2010. “Coach, I think LeBron’s going to the Heat and he’s asking me to go,” Miller told him. “I’ve got a lot of people telling me I can get paid more somewhere else, but I know the Heat are going to have a chance to win it all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller had just endured two unsatisfying seasons in Minnesota and Washington. Those teams had not qualified for the playoffs. In his career, Miller had still never made it past the first round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike, I know this about you: You have always put winning as a first priority,” Donovan said. “I’m not here to tell you what type of financial decision you should make because I don’t know your financial situation, but I know what you’re about. I just hope in the process you stay true to what you’re about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller chose Miami. “I say this with pride,” Miller said of his three years with the Heat. “It was overwhelming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller’s friendship with LeBron James began when James was still in high school. In 2002, Miller and McGrady made time to attend one of James’s nationally televised high school games with St. Vincent–St. Mary. “What I liked about him even then is he impacted the game without scoring,” Miller said. “I saw three minutes of basketball where he didn’t make a bucket. He made a pass that I was like,&lt;em&gt; Oh, OK. This kid has a chance to be really, really special&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller and James remained in touch as James began his NBA career, and the two became closer when Miller played with Team USA in the qualifying tournament for the 2008 Olympics. Miller even named one of his sons Maverick as a partial nod to Maverick Carter. “He helped me with a lot of stuff early and I tried to help those guys whenever I could,” Miller said. “On top of it, it’s a cool name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller’s game projected as a near-perfect fit for the team that Miami was building around James, Wade, and Bosh. Miller could space the floor with his shooting, plus he’d be a willing passer and smart team defender. That first year, however, Miller’s body betrayed him. Wrist, thumb, and back injuries forced him to sit out half the regular season, and he struggled to find a steady spot in coach Erik Spoelstra’s rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, Miller’s wife, Jennifer, was dealing with a complicated pregnancy, as prenatal tests suggested their child would be born with heart abnormalities. “There might have been two weeks during that whole year and the whole season that I was actually excited or happy, because every appointment I went to, they found something new that they needed to check or something else wrong,” Jennifer recalled. “It was extremely taxing on Michael because he was still playing basketball. [He] still had to go out there and perform and all he could think about was the possibility of our child having to deal with a life full of struggles if she was born with the worst-case scenarios of what they were telling me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their daughter, Jaelyn, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/miami-heat-player-mike-miller-balances-family-basketball/story?id=13764977"&gt;would be born a month premature, with five holes in her heart&lt;/a&gt;. Miller hardly practiced with the team during the final weeks of Jennifer’s pregnancy, shuttling back and forth between the hospital and Miami’s games. “Oddly enough, it made the games easier for me,” Miller said. “Because it was three hours of peace and it put things into perspective. If I missed a jumper, it didn’t affect me the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller recovered enough from his injuries to become a key reserve for the Heat in the 2011 playoffs. But even though Miami charged through the Eastern Conference and seized an early 2-1 lead over the Dallas Mavericks in the Finals, Miami suffered a now-famous collapse, losing the series in six games while James appeared to struggle with the pressure of carrying the Heat to the title. The Heat lost the deciding game on their home floor, then watched Mark Cuban and Dirk Nowitzki celebrate the Mavericks’ championship in a Miami nightclub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As Miller stood near the scorer’s table with James, Chalmers, Chris Andersen, and Ray Allen, he said: “Guys, we’re either going to do something in the next five minutes or we’re all going to be pissed off for another five, six months.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to learn what sacrifices everyone was going to have to make,” Miller said of the Heat. “Everyone was going to have to be OK with those sacrifices. It’s easy to say, ‘to sacrifice.’ You might have to sacrifice shots. You might have to sacrifice minutes. You might have to sacrifice money. The hardest thing about sacrifice is the unknown. If you don’t win a championship, that sacrifice, is it really worth it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller’s injury woes worsened the following season, which was shortened by the 2011 NBA lockout. During the compressed 66-game schedule, which was filled with grueling four-games-in-five-nights stretches, Miller’s back pain was often unbearable, and he found himself wondering if the Heat might use the amnesty provision to release him. Between Miller’s chronic health issues, his relatively high salary, and the luxury taxes the Heat incurred by exceeding the salary cap, Miller suspected the worst. “I knew it was a possibility the day we signed the new collective bargaining agreement,” he said. “You do the math: &lt;em&gt;OK, the Miami Heat are going to pay $23 million in taxes this year. Is it really going to be worth it to them?&lt;/em&gt; And then you’re looking down the line and I was the fourth-highest-paid player. They’re not going to do it to the three [top] guys. So the writing was on the wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the playoffs, however, Miller patched himself together and showed flashes that would make Miami postpone any plans to let him go. As the Heat took a 3-1 series lead into Game 5 of the NBA Finals against Oklahoma City, Miller told himself: &lt;em&gt;If I’m going to leave my stamp on this game, I’ve got to be aggressive early&lt;/em&gt;. “I knew Coach &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; rightfully so &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; would have a short leash with me,” he said. “If I didn’t make an impact early, they would have to go with someone else because of my health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller subbed in for Wade about eight minutes into the first quarter. About a minute later, Mario Chalmers fed him for a corner 3 &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; his first of the game. He had wondered how he would respond in this situation, when the ball found him in a crucial moment with a championship within his team’s grasp and he needed to find the bottom of the net. As a kid, he had watched role players like Steve Kerr, John Paxson, and Robert Horry rise to the occasion in clutch situations. As he released that first 3, Miller said he felt like he was in a movie and he could press pause. Throughout the game, the ball kept finding him in the perfect place at the perfect time, and Miller kept burying jumpers until Oklahoma City had also been buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had some good runs in the league and scored good points, but I never shot on a big stage,” Miller said. “I’d never been out of the first round of the playoffs. I wanted to see how I would react. Being injured that whole time and then doing it &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; it was the best feeling. Getting in that zone is something you can’t prepare for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller made seven of eight 3-pointers and Miami romped to a 121-106 win over the Thunder to claim the first championship of the Big Three era. “All the stuff he went through, nobody remembered him not playing,” Haslem said. “Everybody remembers him for being big for us in the biggest moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, Miller didn’t go out to celebrate with his teammates. He went home to rest. “An hour after the game, you ask my wife, [getting] to the bathroom was hard,” he said. Miller thought he had over-trained throughout his career and he suspected it was catching up with him and his body was breaking down. He debated retiring, and told Miami’s front office that he’d walk away from the sport if he couldn’t get healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Miller returned to Miami and made it through another season in 2012-13. He managed to play 59 games, 20 more than he played the previous year and 18 more than in his first year in South Florida. And when June 2013 rolled around, there were Miller, James, and the rest of the Heat, playing for an NBA championship for the third straight time. Miller made several big plays in the back-and-forth seven-game series against San Antonio that will likely go down as one of the greatest Finals in league history, but he saved his most spectacular moment for an epic Game 6. With the Spurs up 10 points at the beginning of the fourth quarter and holding a 3-2 series lead, San Antonio seemed on the verge of adding another Larry O’Brien Trophy to owner Peter Holt’s mantel. As Miller stood near the scorer’s table with James, Chalmers, Chris Andersen, and Ray Allen, he said: “Guys, we’re either going to do something in the next five minutes or we’re all going to be pissed off for another five, six months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So began Miami’s comeback. Chalmers started the quarter with a 3-pointer. James followed with a layup. Soon after, Miller lost his left shoe while defending a Tiago Splitter post-up. “I couldn’t get it on, so I just threw it to the sideline [and] tried to space the floor for LeBron,” Miller said. “That’s all I was thinking. Stay out in space, let him go to work and I’ll foul someone next time down.” Gary Neal made the mistake of assuming that Miller, playing in one sock and one sneaker, was now neutralized, so Neal ran off to double-team James. “He left me and there was nothing else I could do,” Miller said. “If I had tried to dribble, I had sweaty socks on &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; I was going to slide all over the place. So I do what I do best. Let it fly, brother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shot didn’t even draw iron as it passed &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LDH66ja2Zc"&gt;through the net&lt;/a&gt;. “Shoes on, shoes off, high heels, boots, whatever, he’s one of the best shooters I’ve ever seen,” Haslem said. “Once he let it go, I knew it was going down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miami won Game 6 in overtime after erasing a five-point deficit with 28 seconds left in regulation. Miller’s shoeless 3 might have gone down as the shot of the series, if not for Allen’s series-saving, backpedaling corner 3, which tied the game with 5.2 seconds to play, and which many believe is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/nba-finals-game-6-heat-spurs/"&gt;greatest shot in NBA history&lt;/a&gt;. “Ray Allen hit the biggest 3-point shot in my life,” Miller said. The Spurs came back strong in Game 7, but Miami pulled away in the fourth quarter to clinch the series and earn consecutive titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Finals, the Heat announced they wouldn’t use the amnesty provision on Miller, but they changed course in the offseason. “I understood the bigger side of it,” Miller said. “Believe me, I get all that stuff. I learned that for 15 years. The thing that was tough was that we had the chance to do something seriously special. Even if it was waving a towel, I wasn’t there to do it. That’s tough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="miller-mike-james-lebron-miami-heat" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/millerheat1.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ronald Martinez/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;iller returned to Memphis for the 2013-14 season. He told Jason Levien, then the team’s CEO, that his body had never felt better, but given Miller’s injury history it would have been easy to forgive Levien for being skeptical. Miller wound up playing all 82 regular-season games. “There were actually moments last year when I was hoping he would play less because I didn’t want him to get hurt,” Levien said. “But he’s such a competitor that he always wants to be out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memphis started slowly, with both Tony Allen and Marc Gasol missing large chunks of the season to injury, but the Grizzlies got healthy and found their stride as the postseason approached. The Grizzlies earned the seventh seed in the Western Conference playoffs and pushed Oklahoma City to seven games in the first round. Memphis still believes it would have had a strong chance to defeat the Thunder if Zach Randolph hadn’t been suspended for striking Steven Adams in Game 6. “[I] was able to win a playoff game there for myself for once, which was big, and the West was unbelievable,” Miller said. “We had the chance to knock off OKC, and who knows what would have happened if Z-Bo doesn’t get suspended Game 7.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller hoped to re-sign in Memphis after the season. “I thought I was going to finish my career there,” Miller said. “I really did. I was happy there. I wanted to play another three, four years, [and I] thought I could get that done in Memphis.” Instead, the Grizzlies pursued and signed Vince Carter in free agency, which essentially took away Miller’s roster spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Miller wouldn’t wait long for his next opportunity. Soon enough, his old friend and teammate LeBron James came calling with a new mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="miller-mike-cleveland-cavaliers-milwaukee-bucks" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/millercavs.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;leveland would be a challenge for Miller. It meant moving his family for the third time in three years and finding yet another new home in a new city, another new school for his kids. But Miller couldn’t turn down the opportunity to play alongside James and try to win another championship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The history of this city, if they go on to win one and I’m somewhere else &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; that’s the decision I couldn’t live with,” Miller said. “So when it came down to the money, unfortunately I left a lot on the table again. It is what it is, but I’d have a hard time [waking up] every morning if I would have went somewhere else and not had the opportunity to win [a title].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the Denver Nuggets offered Miller a three-year deal worth $12 million, Miller chose to sign in Cleveland for about half as much over two years. “It means everything,” James said of having Miller on the Cavs. “I know how instrumental he was to our championship run in Miami and hated to see him go last year, but I’m happy to be back with him and hopefully we can put together something special here and make a real run at it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cavaliers, as Miller expected, have undergone a somewhat shaky start. Sixteen games into the season, the team is 9-7 and struggling to live up to the championship expectations that get heaped on any franchise that employs LeBron James. There have been players-only meetings, rumored arguments between James and Irving, Love’s gradual adjustment to playing within a new offense, and questions about David Blatt’s effectiveness as a coach and manager of NBA personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“What I do is, I understand people. I understand what they’re going through. The way I do stuff with LeBron is completely different than what I do with Kyrie. Some people need to talk. Some people need to laugh.” &lt;span&gt;—Mike Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We dealt with that in Miami that first year,” Miller said. “Every last one of us from one to 13. Because we had a talented roster. When you tell somebody to sacrifice and it’s uncertain if you’re going to win and it [will] be worth [that sacrifice], it’s tough. That’s what we’re dealing with here in Cleveland now. We’re asking guys to do something that they’re unaccustomed to doing. They’re going to have to buy in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the season, Miller’s sacrifices have been obvious. He’s been a fringe player in Blatt’s rotation, averaging 1.6 points in about 12 minutes per game. He’s recorded DNP–Coach’s Decision stat lines in three of his last four games. “You don’t win championships in November and December,” Miller recently said in response to questions about being stuck on Cleveland’s bench. “So you keep focusing on what we’re doing. Our team is getting better, which is great … Sometimes your job is different. Leadership doesn’t show sometimes, but you can tell when it happens.” And in classic Miller fashion, he rose from the bench in the second half of Tuesday’s victory over the Bucks, after not playing in the first 30-plus minutes of the game, and made several key plays to help bring Cleveland back from an 11-point third-quarter deficit. Likewise, Miller won’t be surprised if the Cavaliers call on him to play the familiar role of late-season savior with a playoff game on the line and the need for someone to hit big shots. “I’m not concerned about makes or misses [in December],” he said. “I’m concerned about makes or misses when they count &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; and I like my chances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller’s steady leadership and guidance will also be key to helping young talents like Irving, Love, and Dion Waiters learn to play for a team with championship aspirations. “Our core guys that we are going to demand a lot from have never been in a playoff game,” Miller said. “How do we help them with that? That’s stuff that we’re working on now. How do we prepare them for that? It’s how you handle the expectations, and it goes back to what I was talking about with sacrifice. It’s so easy to say we’re going to sacrifice. But to jump right in and sacrifice [without] knowing the outcome? It’s very, very difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller has already become good friends with Irving, and he has a solid relationship with Love dating back to Miller’s 2008-09 season with the Timberwolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I really am is a friend first,” Miller said. “I like to be cool with people. Like Kyrie &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; that’s my guy. He’s a great kid, unbelievable point guard. I think I can help him be better. Not a better basketball player. Just understanding things. Dion Waiters, great kid. Sometimes he gets a bad rep. If he fits into his role here, he’s going to be really, really good. I think I can help with that. Kevin Love’s a monster. And LeBron, I’m always going to be on him with positive stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how does a player who seems to be chummy with everyone in the NBA remain competitive when he faces an opponent who’s also a friend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like a code,” Miller said with a laugh. “Everyone knows that. When the ball goes up, whatever happens between those lines, it ain’t nothing personal.”&lt;a href="http://grantland.com/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Miller and Tracy McGrady attended a high school game featuring LeBron James in Philadelphia in February 2002.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&amp;amp;blog=60203239&amp;amp;post=196121&amp;amp;subd=espngrantland&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">With the hot stove smoking and the winter meetings looming, it’s time for the continuation of our annual ranking of baseball’s 50 most valuable assets.&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&amp;amp;blog=60203239&amp;amp;post=196210&amp;amp;subd=espngrantland&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;esterday, we revealed &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; of our annual MLB Trade Value ranking. Today, we’re rounding out the list by dissecting baseball’s 35 most valuable chips. If you need a refresher on the rules that define this thought experiment, head back to yesterday’s piece; if you’re all caught up, proceed accordingly. And remember, last year’s rankings appear in parentheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Group 7: Young, Cheap, Really Good Pitchers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="yordano-ventura-tri" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/yordano-ventura-tri.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ed Zurga/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;35. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yordano Ventura (NR), SP, Kansas City Royals&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34. Sonny Gray (HM), SP, Oakland A’s&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33. Gerrit Cole (26), SP, Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past season reminded us that young pitchers can be &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=1658"&gt;a giant land mine&lt;/a&gt;, and in turn reinforced that the productive ones who make it through their early big league years unscathed are immensely valuable. Ventura, Gray, and Cole are three prime examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 23-year-old Ventura, the youngest and wispiest of the bunch, evokes images of young Pedro Martinez, parlaying his (barely) 6-foot, 180-pound frame into a flamethrowing machine that heaved &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://baseballsavant.com/pitchfx_search.php?hfPT=&amp;amp;hfZ=&amp;amp;hfGT=R%7C&amp;amp;hfPR=&amp;amp;hfAB=&amp;amp;ddlStadium=&amp;amp;hfBB=&amp;amp;hfHL=&amp;amp;hfCount=&amp;amp;ddlYear=2014&amp;amp;ddlPlayer=pitcher&amp;amp;ddlMin=0&amp;amp;ddlPitcherHand=&amp;amp;ddlBatterHand=&amp;amp;ddlVGT=100&amp;amp;ddlVLT=&amp;amp;ddlDistGT=&amp;amp;ddlDistLT=&amp;amp;txtAngleGT=&amp;amp;txtAngleLT=&amp;amp;txtGameDateGT=&amp;amp;txtGameDateLT=&amp;amp;ddlPlayerHeightGT=&amp;amp;ddlPlayerHeightLT=&amp;amp;ddlPlayerWeightGT=&amp;amp;ddlPlayerWeightLT=&amp;amp;ddlTeam=&amp;amp;ddlPosition=&amp;amp;hfRO=&amp;amp;ddlHomeRoad=&amp;amp;hfIN=&amp;amp;hfOT=&amp;amp;ddlGroupBy=name&amp;amp;ddlSort=desc&amp;amp;ddlMinABs=0&amp;amp;ddlSBSuccess=&amp;amp;txtPx1=&amp;amp;txtPx2=&amp;amp;txtPz1=&amp;amp;txtPz2=&amp;amp;ddlRPXGT_ft=&amp;amp;ddlRPXGT_in=&amp;amp;ddlRPXLT_ft=&amp;amp;ddlRPXLT_in=&amp;amp;ddlRPYGT_ft=&amp;amp;ddlRPYGT_in=&amp;amp;ddlRPYLT_ft=&amp;amp;ddlRPYLT_in=&amp;amp;txtBAGT=&amp;amp;txtBALT=&amp;amp;txtBLGT=&amp;amp;txtBLLT=&amp;amp;txtSRGT=&amp;amp;txtSRLT=&amp;amp;txtSDGT=&amp;amp;txtSDLT=#results"&gt;more 100 mph fastballs&lt;/a&gt; last season than any other starting pitcher. Pushing the Pedro comparison any further would be patently unfair, of course, and the Royals have to be thrilled with a guy who gave them 30 regular-season starts as a rookie, produced a park-adjusted ERA 25 percent better than league average, shook off some minor concerns over a late-season shoulder issue, and still had enough in the tank to fire seven shutout innings in Game 6 of the World Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Cole and Gray, who are just 24 and 25 years old, respectively, both delivered consolidation years: Cole allowed more runs than in 2013, but ramped up his strikeout rate to an even one per inning; Gray posted slightly inferior peripheral stats than in his 64-inning debut season, but established &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12768&amp;amp;position=P#pitchvalues"&gt;one of the best&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.brooksbaseball.net/outcome.php?player=543243&amp;amp;time=&amp;amp;startDate=03/30/2007&amp;amp;endDate=12/03/2014&amp;amp;s_type=2"&gt;curveball-slider&lt;/a&gt; combinations in the game and tossed 219 effective innings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three are young, cheap, highly effective, and healthy. Further improvement could push them even higher up this list next year, and team-friendly contract extensions could make them nearly untouchable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 8: I Say AND-Rel-Ton, You Say And-REL-Ton, Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="andrelton-simmons-braves" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/andrelton-simmons-braves.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott Cunningham/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32. Andrelton Simmons (39), SS, Atlanta Braves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what two MLB talent evaluators had to say about the Braves’ 25-year-old shortstop after I showed them a preliminary version of the top 50:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;h4&gt;More Trade Value Rankings&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/nba-trade-value/"&gt;Bill Simmons on the NBA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/nfl-trade-value/"&gt;Bill Barnwell on the NFL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/mlb-trade-value/"&gt;Jonah Keri on MLB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/trade-value/"&gt;All Trade Value!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;1. “Simmons is an awesome defender. AWESOME. Hard for me to bite down that a guy with a .290 on-base is the 35th-most valuable asset in baseball.”
&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;“He needs to be higher for me — in the 10-20 range. It’s a crazy-good contract, and he’s a better hitter than what he has shown. Plus the defense is so good at the most important position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compromised, because both gentlemen made fair points. But, man, this one’s tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he entered the league just two-plus years ago, Simmons has already drawn comparisons to Ozzie Smith thanks to his defensive brilliance, which is saying something considering that the Wizard might’ve been the most valuable defender in baseball history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height="336" width="600" src="http://mlb.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=35722799&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=336&amp;amp;property=mlb"&gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evoking a name like Ozzie’s is a huge deal, but quantifying how much value Simmons (or any player) brings defensively remains difficult. According to Baseball-Reference, Simmons generated 5.4 WAR in 2013 and 3.9 in 2014 &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/simmoan01.shtml#batting_value::none"&gt;with his glove alone&lt;/a&gt;; Nelson Cruz, who led baseball with 40 homers last year, generated 4.2 WAR &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cruzne02.shtml#batting_value::none"&gt;with his bat&lt;/a&gt;. If we believe those numbers, we accept that the Braves have a player who, before even picking up a bat, generates as much or more value than the sport’s top power hitter. Paired with his youth and favorable contract (six more years for a total of just $56 million), that defensive impact would seem to make Simmons ludicrously valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simmons’s total WAR (3.5) was lower than his dWAR last year, however, which brings us to the rub: There are still major questions about his bat. His line plunged to .244/.286/.331 in his second full season, with his homer total dropping from 17 in 2013 to seven last year. In total, Simmons clocked in as the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=17,a"&gt;sixth-worst&lt;/a&gt; everyday hitter in the majors last year on a park-adjusted basis. One baseball insider I spoke to said Simmons looked uncomfortable and off-balance at the plate last season, making it incredibly tough for him to square up pitches and drive them, despite his overall athletic ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that, as spectacular as Simmons is at short, advanced defensive metrics like Defensive Runs Saved and Ultimate Zone Rating might overstate his value a bit. Until a new measure like &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/mlb-advanced-media-play-tracking-bob-bowman-interview"&gt;StatCast&lt;/a&gt; gives us detailed, play-by-play-driven numbers for every player in baseball, the defensive stats we have are basically estimates, which we can’t fully trust in small samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a given that any team would want Simmons in its infield or highlight reel. It’s less clear where he currently ranks among the game’s greats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 9: The Place Where Grounders Go to Die&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="nolan-arenado-troy-tulowitzki-rockies" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/nolan-arenado-troy-tulowitzki-rockies.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31. Troy Tulowitzki (18), SS, Colorado Rockies&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30. Nolan Arenado (NR), 3B, Colorado Rockies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Braves have a human vacuum cleaner patrolling the left side of their infield, but the Rockies have &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; in Tulowitzki and Arenado. Tulo’s a well-known two-way star by now, but those outside Colorado might not be as familiar with the 23-year-old Arenado, whose two Gold Glove Awards in his first two seasons are &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=3b&amp;amp;stats=fld&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0"&gt;justified by the numbers&lt;/a&gt;. Though he’s not in Tulowitzki’s class as a hitter, Arenado’s combination of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=3b&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=800&amp;amp;type=5&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=8,d"&gt;excellent contact skills&lt;/a&gt; and burgeoning power (even after adjusting for Coors Field) makes him a potential star. Tulo and Carlos Gonzalez may be the faces of the franchise right now, but the development of young players like Arenado and Corey Dickerson — both Rockies property for at least the next five years — could play a bigger role in the team’s attempted return to relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="358" alt="nolan-arenado-throw" width="475" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/nolan-arenado-throw_gif_static.gif?w=475&amp;amp;h=358" data-animate="http://i1.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/nolan-arenado-throw.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s partly due to questions surrounding Tulowitzki’s long-term status. He looked like Ted Williams at the beginning of 2014, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/troy-tulowitzki-colorado-rockies-historic-start/"&gt;hitting well over .400&lt;/a&gt; while roping line drives all over the park and launching titanic home runs, but he’s also 30 years old and has been crushed by injuries, averaging just 88 games per year over the past three seasons. Granted, he was so dominant in 2014 that he posted a 5.5 WAR despite logging just 91 games. And yes, the dearth of talent at shortstop would create molten-hot demand in certain corners if new GM Jeff Bridich ever made Tulo available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, given his age, his injury history, and the six years and $114 million (plus a seventh, $15 million club option year) remaining on his contract, only a select group of bidders would actually emerge. It’s not hard to envision the Dodgers handing over half their prospects to get Tulo, even with farm system devotees Andrew Friedman and Stan Kasten at the helm; conversely, it’s nearly impossible to imagine Friedman’s former team in Tampa Bay even picking up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 10: Cardinal Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="yadier-molina-adam-wainwright-cardinals" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/yadier-molina-adam-wainwright-cardinals.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harry E. Walker/MCT/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29. Yadier Molina (12), C, St. Louis Cardinals&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28. Adam Wainwright (21), SP, St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2011 through 2013, Molina batted .313/.361/.481, making him the NL’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=800&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2013&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2011&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=17,d"&gt;16th-best&lt;/a&gt; hitter in that span. When he hits like that, he’s arguably the best player on the senior circuit, an offensive threat and a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/st-louis-cardinals-yadier-molina-catcher-value-game-calling/"&gt;defensive magician&lt;/a&gt; by any metric. But his numbers fell off sharply last season (.282/.333/.386), with injuries limiting Molina to his lowest games-played total (110) since his rookie year in 2004. If that drop-off continues, he’ll be another Simmons, an all-world defender with iffy offensive value — only he’ll be 32 years old and owed $43 million over the final three years of his contract (plus a $2 million buyout or $15 million salary for his 2018 mutual option year). This ranking is banking on some positive regression in 2015 and beyond; if that doesn’t happen, he won’t be in this rarefied air much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainwright is actually a year older than his batterymate, and his contract is even more expensive, at $78 million over the next four years. The right-hander’s strikeout rate fell below 20 percent last season for the first time since 2008, though, and his 90 mph fastball leaves him in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=5&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=11,d"&gt;middle of the pack&lt;/a&gt; for missing bats. He owed some of his 2014 success to an unusually high 78 percent strand rate and career-low .267 batting average on balls in play despite ranking in the middle in ESPN’s hard-hit average stat. Still, it’s foolish to go overboard poking holes in Wainwright’s game. He posted a 2.88 FIP last season and remains a walking advertisement for &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/st-louis-cardinals-pitchers-dave-duncan-adam-wainwright-michael-wacha/"&gt;Dave Duncan’s approach&lt;/a&gt; to limiting hard contact, befuddling hitters with a knee-buckling curveball down in the zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="324" alt="adam-wainwright-heat-map" width="576" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/adam-wainwright-heat-map.png?w=576&amp;amp;h=324"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: He’s an ace, he’s essential to the Cardinals’ success, and he’s not going anywhere anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 11: Building Blocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="julio-teheran-freddie-freeman-braves" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/julio-teheran-freddie-freeman-braves.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott Cunningham/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27. Julio Teheran (HM), SP, Atlanta Braves&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26. Freddie Freeman (38), 1B, Atlanta Braves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teheran is 23 years old, wields &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=6797&amp;amp;position=P#pitchvalues"&gt;three excellent out pitches&lt;/a&gt;, just completed a season in which he fired 221 innings with a 2.89 ERA, and is owed just $29.6 million over the next five years (or $41.6 million if the Braves pick up his 2020 option). Freeman is 25, he’s been the NL’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=17,d"&gt;seventh-best&lt;/a&gt; hitter on a park-adjusted basis over the past two years, and he’s delivered the kind of early power numbers that often portend a bigger breakout; one talent evaluator I consulted predicted an Adrian Gonzalez–in–San Diego type of surge in the near future. Atlanta signed Freeman to an eight-year, $135 million extension last offseason, giving the team the benefit of his prime years without any commitment past his age-31 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Braves have been scouting and player-development masters for the past quarter-century, and Teheran and Freeman are the latest — and potentially two of the greatest — links in that chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 12: The No-Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="yan-gomes-indians" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/yan-gomes-indians.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Miller/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25. Yan Gomes (NR), C, Cleveland Indians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the minor leaguers, Gomes is probably the player on this list who has the least name-recognition among casual fans. That won’t be the case for long. Toronto drafted Gomes in the 10th round in 2009 and dealt him in 2012 for Esmil Rogers, a trade the Jays surely regret, and one that contributed to their decision to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/braves-cardinals-jason-heyward-trade-blue-jays-russell-martin-signing/"&gt;spend $82 million&lt;/a&gt; on Russell Martin this offseason. Gomes has quietly grown into one of the AL’s best all-around players, bashing 21 homers and posting a .278/.313/.472 line in 2014 while displaying &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.statcorner.com/CatcherReport.php"&gt;strong pitch-framing skills&lt;/a&gt; and playing generally excellent defense. He’s 27 years old, he’s owed a paltry $20.95 million over the next five years, and the Tribe would need to spend only another $20 million to lock him up through 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Indians were as good at signing &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8774649/nick-swisher-cleveland-indians-agree-4-year-deal-source"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/41546894/michael-bourn-gets-four-year-48-million-contract-from-busy-indians"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; as they are trading for &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5426165"&gt;unheralded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/3084786/"&gt;prospects&lt;/a&gt;, they’d be a damn dynasty by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 13: Fish Tales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="jose-fernandez-marlins" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/jose-fernandez-marlins.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24. Jose Fernandez (6), SP, Miami Marlins&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23. Christian Yelich (HM), OF, Miami Marlins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS Sports’s Jon Heyman recently reported that the Marlins have made or plan to make &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/writer/jon-heyman/24855727/marlins-make-long-term-offers-to-jose-fernandez-core-young-players"&gt;long-term contract offers&lt;/a&gt; to four young players: Marcell Ozuna, Adeiny Hechavarria, Fernandez, and Yelich. That makes a ton of sense, and after years of spending big only to shed bigger, it could help rebuild some goodwill locally, which would be a welcome development with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2011-05-05/news/six-lies-about-the-marlins-stadium/"&gt;$2.4 billion in taxes&lt;/a&gt; going toward the team’s new stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a particularly sound strategy when it comes to Yelich and Fernandez. Yelich is basically a Nick Markakis starter kit, an athletic, high-on-base guy with the potential to smash an unholy number of doubles. FanGraphs credited him with 4.3 WAR last season, and he turns 23 tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Fernandez has earned my &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/putting-jose-fernandez-in-perspective/"&gt;undying love&lt;/a&gt; thanks to his &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.brooksbaseball.net/outcome.php?player=605228&amp;amp;time=&amp;amp;startDate=03/30/2007&amp;amp;endDate=12/02/2014&amp;amp;s_type=2"&gt;filthy repertoire&lt;/a&gt;, incredible combination of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://i.minus.com/ibd7dgjN0UsxhZ.gif"&gt;swagger and joie de vivre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/marlins-rookie-pitcher-jose-fernandez-journey-cuban-defector-mlb-all-star/"&gt;inspiring journey to America&lt;/a&gt;. Offering him a reported six-year, $40 million deal with multiple club options while he’s recovering from Tommy John surgery at age 22 is a clever attempt to take advantage of an uncertain time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all four players might be more receptive to sticking around now that Giancarlo Stanton &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/giancarlo-stanton-miami-marlins-13-year-325-million-contract/"&gt;has signed&lt;/a&gt; on the dotted line, going from offer to ink won’t be easy. Yelich and Ozuna have enough offensive potential to demand serious money even five years before free agency. Fernandez, who’s four years away from cashing in, is represented by Scott Boras, who’s notoriously reluctant to let star clients give up valuable free-agent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Yelich and Fernandez are rising stars, and immensely valuable assets whether or not they sign extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 14: Really Good Third Basemen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="evan-longoria-rays" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/evan-longoria-rays.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abelimages/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22. Josh Donaldson (36), 3B, Toronto Blue Jays&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21. Evan Longoria (4), 3B, Tampa Bay Rays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=3b&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0"&gt;By WAR&lt;/a&gt;, Donaldson has been the game’s most valuable third baseman over the past two years, and Longoria the fifth. Donaldson, of course, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/josh-donaldson-trade-oakland-toronto-billy-beane/"&gt;actually was traded&lt;/a&gt;, and just a week ago. Whether you buy that Billy Beane dealt his star due in part to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/report--josh-donaldson-clashed-with-billy-beane-before-trade-005754140.html"&gt;verbal confrontation&lt;/a&gt; or simply chalk up the move to Oakland’s typical sell-high strategy, it was jarring to see the A’s trade a star who’s still four years away from free agency, even if Donaldson is a few days away from turning 29. Consider this ranking a reflection of his hypothetical value should the Blue Jays turn around and trade him again and not a verdict on what the A’s actually got for him, which most industry insiders agree wasn’t much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Rays need to hope that Longoria can halt a disturbing trend in his offensive numbers, as his wRC+ has dipped from 146 to 133 to 107 the last three years. Hopefully that’s the product of nagging injuries and a random down year and not a true regression, because the guy who was the sport’s most valuable trade commodity when he was putting up big numbers and making peanuts becomes much less desirable as a 29-year-old owed $116.5 million over the next eight seasons (with a $13 million club option and $5 million buyout for a ninth year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 15: Apples to Kumquats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="yu-darvish-rangers" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/yu-darvish-rangers.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nick Cammett/Diamond Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20. Felix Hernandez (20), SP, Seattle Mariners&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. Salvador Perez (35), C, Kansas City Royals&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. Kris Bryant (NR), 3B, Chicago Cubs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. Yu Darvish (11), SP, Texas Rangers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prospect at no. 18! This is where things get really interesting, and really relative: The Yankees, who are always willing to spend big and have to try to sell $1,000 tickets, would have a hard time passing on King Felix, even though he’s owed $128 million over the next five years and will be in his age-33 season when that deal ends; the Pirates, who always pinch pennies and fetishize young talent, would surely covet a blue-chipper like Bryant, who could conceivably belt 200 homers in the six years for which they’d control him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/mvp-cy-young-clayton-kershaw-felix-hernandez/"&gt;lauded&lt;/a&gt; King Felix &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/27-perfect-things-about-felix-hernandezs-perfect-game"&gt;more times&lt;/a&gt; than I can count, and there’s not much new to say about the perennial Cy Young contender. Bryant, however, is fresh Trade Value fodder. Admittedly, this is an aggressive ranking for a player who’s never seen a pitch in the big leagues, but several factors work in his favor. For one thing, Bryant isn’t a pitcher, so his risk of major injury or sudden skill erosion is comparatively low. For another, he’s a damn beast. No amount of park adjusting or number manipulating can douse the .325/.438/.661 beating he laid on Double-A and Triple-A pitchers last season, when he launched 43 homers in 138 games. He’s an all-world talent, he doesn’t turn 23 until January, and he’s one of the biggest reasons to start fearing the Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height="336" width="600" src="http://mlb.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=31404685&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=336&amp;amp;property=mlb"&gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not the only crazy value in this group, though. Darvish has lived up to the hype and then some, plowing through the league in each of his first three seasons. Though injuries curtailed his 2014 campaign a bit, he still enjoyed his best season by fielding-independent metrics on a per-inning basis anyway. Assuming he’s healthy come Opening Day, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2012&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=7,d"&gt;the most prolific strikeout artist&lt;/a&gt; on the planet will be mowing down batters for a measly $31 million over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, while &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/rating-players-contracts-major-league-baseball-part-1/"&gt;the Great Salvador Perez Debate&lt;/a&gt; used to be a big talking point at Grantland, there’s no longer much to argue about. Perez has become a defensive star for K.C., and he’s a better offensive player than he showed in 2014; his lukewarm year-end stats stem from Ned Yost running Perez into the ground with excessive playing time, not from any major flaw in the catcher’s game. If the Royals find a half-decent backup for 2015 and give Perez a few more days off, the 24-year-old emerging star will be an undeniable value at $18.5 million over the next five years (including three option years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 16: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6TLWqn82J4"&gt;It’s the Tribe, Y’all!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="corey-kluber-indians" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/corey-kluber-indians.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Liam Kyle/NBAE via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. Michael Brantley (NR), OF, Cleveland Indians&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Corey Kluber (NR), SP, Cleveland Indians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the Indians’ impressive prospect-thievery skills earlier, and here’s further proof: They got Brantley as a throw-in for CC Sabathia and got Kluber as an afterthought in a random Jake Westbrook–Ryan Ludwick three-way exchange. Not too shabby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Brantley blossomed from a decent all-around player to a .327/.385/.506 one-man wrecking crew who might be even better than his 7.0 WAR indicated. Brantley’s batting average on balls in play spiked to a career-high .333 in 2014, but there’s reason to believe that might not be a fluke: According to ESPN Stats &amp;amp; Info, he ranked eighth in the majors in hard-hit average, trailing only David Ortiz, Miguel Cabrera, Victor Martinez, Andrew McCutchen, Adrian Beltre, Edwin Encarnacion, and Lucas Duda. At $19 million over the next three years (with an $11 million club option for 2018),&lt;a data-footnote-id="2" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-2/#fn-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the 27-year-old has emerged as a cornerstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As impressive as Brantley was, though, he took second billing to fellow breakout sensation Kluber, who tossed 235.2 innings, punched out 269 batters, posted a 2.44 ERA, and won the damn Cy Young. Kluber is 28, Indians property for four more seasons, and isn’t even arbitration-eligible yet. Brantley and Kluber earned two of the top four spots on my &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/mlb-awards-2014-al-nl-mvp-cy-young-rookie-of-the-year/"&gt;fake AL MVP ballot&lt;/a&gt; for 2014, and should continue earning that kind of recognition for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 17: NL East Franchise Players&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="matt-harvey-mets" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/matt-harvey-mets.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim McIsaac/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Giancarlo Stanton (16), OF, Miami Marlins&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Matt Harvey (17), SP, New York Mets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanton just signed the richest contract in American pro team sports history, yet moved up two spots from last year. The “Hey, Keri, enjoying those Colorado weed laws?” tweets are inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved him up because I think he’s going to opt out of his new deal, and if that’s the case, the $107 million he’s set to earn over the next six years doesn’t look so scary. Most baseball players are better in their twenties than their thirties, so as good as Stanton is, paying him more than $200 million on the back end of his extension would likely be more of a curse than a privilege. (Just ask the people who signed Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, or Mark Teixeira. Or, probably a few years down the road, Miguel Cabrera.) Of course, there’s always the possibility that Stanton could get hurt &lt;span&gt;tomorrow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ruin&lt;/span&gt; his rocket ride toward 500 homers and superstardom, and pass on opting out, which would make him a burden instead of a value. There are no guarantees, but I’m choosing to believe that the physical specimen who just tuned 25, blasted 37 homers, and was the NL’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=17,d"&gt;second-best&lt;/a&gt; offensive player last year will keep the good times rolling for seasons to come, and maybe even get better as his plate discipline continues to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey also moved up from last year, though that’s easier to figure out: If he was a top-20 guy heading into a season that he was guaranteed to miss while recovering from Tommy John, he’s got to move up now that he’s expected to be healthy and back to his old, lights-out self. Harvey’s pre-injury 2013 numbers (178.1 innings pitched, 191 strikeouts, 30 unintentional walks, seven home runs allowed) established him as a top-five-caliber pitcher and short-list Cy Young contender. He’s still only 25 years old, he can dominate with four different pitches,&lt;a data-footnote-id="3" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-2/#fn-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he’s a year away from arbitration, and he’s under team control for four more years. Even if the Mets &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/matt-harvey--mets-finally-in-agreement-about-his-tommy-john-return-200040136.html"&gt;limit his innings&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, Harvey will be a stud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 18: Catching Fire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="jonathan-lucroy-brewers-tri" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/jonathan-lucroy-brewers-tri.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rob Tringali/SportsChrome/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Jonathan Lucroy (44), C, Milwaukee Brewers&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Buster Posey (5), C, San Francisco Giants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six catchers cracked this year’s top 50, which speaks to teams’ growing recognition of a top backstop’s value and their understanding that a good, two-way receiver who pops 10 to 15 homers can be as valuable as a slugging first baseman who cranks 35 to 40 … and considerably cheaper. The Royals saw that kind of potential in Perez, the Indians saw it in Gomes, and the Brewers saw it in Lucroy, which is why the 28-year-old who just posted a 6.7-WAR season will make the criminally low sum of $12.25 million over the next three seasons (the third a club option that Milwaukee will surely pick up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.statcorner.com/CatcherReport.php"&gt;pitch-framing numbers&lt;/a&gt; at face value, we can assume Lucroy was actually closer to an eight- or nine-win player in 2014, which would have made him the most valuable player in baseball.&lt;a data-footnote-id="4" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-2/#fn-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Regardless of how much stock you put in pitch-framing, though, you have to appreciate a defensively gifted catcher who played 153 games and hit .301/.373/.465 during a lousy year for offense leaguewide. For the money he’s making, that’s insane value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posey isn’t nearly as cheap after signing a megadeal that still has seven years and $143.5 million left (plus a $22 million club option), but he’s got a longer track record of stardom, with a rookie of the year nod, an MVP award, and three World Series rings already in hand. Despite that hefty résumé, he’ll be just 28 come Opening Day. Posey will likely lose some value if he moves to first base in the coming years,&lt;a data-footnote-id="5" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-2/#fn-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but we shouldn’t quibble too much about a perennial MVP candidate in his prime and locked up for nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 19: Fearsome Fivesome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="bryce-harper-tri" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/bryce-harper-tri.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Yasiel Puig (14), OF, Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Anthony Rendon (NR), 3B/2B, Washington Nationals&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Jose Abreu (NR), 1B, Chicago White Sox&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Anthony Rizzo (NR), 1B, Chicago Cubs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Bryce Harper (3), OF, Washington Nationals &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tricky element to evaluating a player’s long-term value is deciding how much credit a team should get for owning an exclusive negotiating window to re-sign him. Last year, I ranked Clayton Kershaw 29th despite him being only a year away from free agency because (1) he’s Clayton f’ing Kershaw, and (2) the Dodgers had a chance to negotiate with him a year before anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rendon and Harper aren’t close to free agency yet, but it’s still worth thinking about their futures in these terms. Rendon, who’ll play his age-25 season next year, is bound to his employer through 2019. Harper, who just turned 22, offers control through 2018. Rendon hit .287/.351/.473 in his first full season, with 21 homers, 17 steals, plus baserunning, and strong defense at second and third. Though he’d long been a top prospect, that kind of breakthrough was a little surprising, especially given his injury history. Speaking of injuries: Harper suffered through a second straight injury-shortened season, and his numbers faded after a big 2013 campaign. He’s still widely considered the most athletically gifted player in the NL, though, and he was 25 percent better than league average offensively (per wRC+) through his age-21 season; by comparison, Miguel Cabrera was plus-21 percent through that same age, but Harper offers more speed, athleticism, and defensive skill than Cabrera ever did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these guys are really good, really young, and currently really cheap. However, they’re also Boras clients, negating the likelihood they’ll sign extensions. That’s particularly noteworthy with Harper, who’s set to become a free agent before his peak baseball-playing age, and who’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2014/12/01/nationals-bryce-harper-could-land-in-grievance-hearing-this-month/"&gt;in a dispute&lt;/a&gt; with the Nats over entering arbitration a year early. If Washington had better odds of locking up these youngsters, both Rendon and Harper would rate even higher on this list. Given the Boras wrinkle, though, this is as far as I’m willing to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two star first basemen playing in Chicago bring no such dilemmas, because they’ve both signed recent deals. The White Sox get to employ Abreu — the reigning rookie of the year and MVP candidate — for the next five years for just $51 million. The Cubs have an even better deal with Rizzo, whom they’ve got for five years at $35 million, plus a pair of $14.5 million club options in 2020 and 2021 that look supremely reasonable for a 25-year-old slugger who just batted .286/.386/.527 (the NL’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=17,d"&gt;third-best&lt;/a&gt; park-adjusted line) while flashing a solid glove. Right now, there’s nothing to dislike about either player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s Puig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="445" alt="yasiel-puig-helmet" width="625" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/yasiel-puig-helmet_gif_static.gif?w=625&amp;amp;h=445" data-animate="http://i2.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/yasiel-puig-helmet.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/jonah-keri-ranks-mlb-teams-24/"&gt;absolutely adore&lt;/a&gt; the Wild Horse for his reckless baserunning, give-zero-F’s throws, and high-flourish &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/the-30-cubs-mets-nationals-angels-run-differential/"&gt;bat flips&lt;/a&gt; and still acknowledge that some people who matter (including some teammates and occasionally his manager) justifiably consider Puig a bit of a pain in the ass. Still, we’re talking about a career .305/.386/.502 hitter who turns 24 this weekend and is one of the best reasons to flip on a ballgame or make a pilgrimage to Dodger Stadium. Though he’s owed a paltry $24 million over the next four years, he can opt into arbitration after his third year of MLB service. Regardless of the dollar figure affixed to his name, he’ll be &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;good and &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;fun to watch. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny him that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 20: Lefty Aces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="San Francisco Giants v Detroit Tigers" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/madison-bumgarner-tri-e1411651643990.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mark Cunningham/MLB Photos/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Madison Bumgarner (13), SP, San Francisco Giants&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Chris Sale (10), SP, Chicago White Sox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that pitchers always carry some risk, but these two are too good to ignore. Figuring out where to put them in the top 50 was a fun exercise, but it’s actually more interesting to debate their value relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for Bumgarner: He’s 25 years old, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=16,a"&gt;seventh&lt;/a&gt; in ERA (2.88) over the past two years, has never been on the DL, has three World Series rings, and has a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2014-mlb-playoffs-san-francisco-giants-win-world-series-madison-bumgarner-kansas-city-royals/"&gt;Bob Gibson–esque reputation&lt;/a&gt; for World Series dominance. He’s a whale of a value at $52 million over the next five seasons, including two no-brainer option years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for Sale: He’s 25 years old; fourth in ERA (2.67), fourth in strikeout rate, and fourth in strikeout-to-walk rate over the past two years; has one career DL stint; and pitches in the tougher league. And as with Bumgarner, he’s a steal over the next five seasons (including two option years), at just north of $53 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might argue that Bumgarner should get the edge based on durability, given how physically imposing he is compared to the 6-foot-6, 180-pound Sale, and given how thoroughly he dominated this postseason, up to and including his incredible Series-clinching Game 7 relief appearance that brought his season-long innings-pitched total to an amazing 270 (not counting spring training). Heck, those who put stock in postseason mystique and a pitcher’s ability to rise to the occasion when the lights shine brightest might argue for Bumgarner as the most valuable commodity in baseball right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, Sale gets the slightest edge because of his superior regular-season performance and one looming but alarming question: Does Bumgarner’s unforgettable October elevate his status, or merely elevate his innings total to a point that could jeopardize his future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 21: Worthy Runners-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="paul-goldschmidt-diamondbacks" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/paul-goldschmidt-diamondbacks.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott Cunningham/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Paul Goldschmidt (8), 1B, Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Andrew McCutchen (2), OF, Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more enticing: four years (including an option) and $51.5 million for the now-28-year-old 2013 MVP, or five years (including an option) and $43 million for the now-27-year-old 2013 MVP runner-up? We’re giving this one to Cutch, because it’s incredibly hard to find a player with a .300-plus batting average, .400-plus on-base percentage, and .500-plus slugging average three years in a row. In fact, McCutchen is the only player sitting on such a streak. To manage that while manning center field — as opposed to the comparably easy task of playing first base — is a damn miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe height="300" width="300" src="https://vine.co/v/bllmZug0niJ/embed/simple"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t minimize how lucky the D-Backs are to have Goldy, though. The former eighth-round draft pick was never a top-100 prospect and had his .317/.407/.620 minor league line waved off as the product of hitter-friendly leagues and ballparks, yet 462 games into his major league career he’s a .292/.381/.523 hitter who could maintain that production for years to come. He also brings a rare power and speed combo for a big first baseman, with 83 dingers and 46 steals to date. Baseball is so weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 22: You Know You’re Good When Your Worst Season Wins an MVP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Mike Trout (1), OF, Los Angeles Angels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="mike-trout-angels" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/mike-trout-angels.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though 2012 and 2013 awards voters might disagree, Trout has been the best player in baseball for three years running, and he finally bagged his first MVP trophy in 2014 despite his numbers dropping from “Are you f’ing kidding me?!” to “DAAAAAAMMMMNNN!!!!” Think about that three-year sample, then consider that Trout is only five months older than Bryant, the next big thing who’s still waiting for a crack at the Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since checking in at no. 1 last year, Trout has signed a six-year, $144.5 million extension that goes into effect in 2015. As with Stanton, Trout’s new deal means he’s no longer cheap — but it also means the Angels get three years of control they didn’t have before. And in today’s market, the $33.25 million a year Trout is guaranteed in each of those three seasons is actually a big bargain, valuing him as something like a five-win player when he’s been nearly twice that good to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, he’s 23 years old! This entire exercise is built on the premise that young, cheap, awesome players are the ideal commodity, but Trout will probably still be special enough to remain a Trade Value staple when some team is giving him $400 million in his thirties. No matter what, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v22643503/laabal-trout-takes-a-homer-away-from-hardy"&gt;he’s a catch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="http://grantland.com/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&amp;amp;blog=60203239&amp;amp;post=196210&amp;amp;subd=espngrantland&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</content>

        <content type="html">&lt;img height="360" alt="Aston Martin DB10 from James Bond Spectre" width="640" src="http://img.qz.com/2014/12/james-bond-db10.jpg?w=640"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 6, 2015, James Bond will return to theaters &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/007/status/540470229978316800"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Spectre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director Sam Mendes’ follow-up to the colossal 2012 hit &lt;em&gt;Skyfall&lt;/em&gt;. Daniel Craig, once again, stars as the venerated secret agent. Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz will play a character known only as “Oberhauser,” though it’s rumored he’ll actually be portraying the famous Bond supervillain &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld"&gt;Ernst Stavro Blofeld&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also joining the cast: the brand new Aston Martin DB10. Bond has driven several models made by the British luxury sports car manufacturer over the years, but this one is slightly different. The bespoke DB10 was designed specifically for &lt;em&gt;Spectre&lt;/em&gt;, with input from Sam Mendes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote width="500"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiled: The Aston Martin DB10 – James Bond's new car in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPECTRE?src=hash"&gt;#SPECTRE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoodToBeBond?src=hash"&gt;#GoodToBeBond&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://t.co/y4Z1iFmoEK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/y4Z1iFmoEK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Aston Martin (@astonmartin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/astonmartin/status/540462249463529472"&gt;December 4, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_vehicles#Aston_Martin"&gt;10th time 007 has driven an Aston Martin&lt;/a&gt;—he sported the classic DB5 in &lt;em&gt;Skyfall&lt;/em&gt;, the same car Sean Connery’s Bond drove in &lt;em&gt;Goldfinger&lt;/em&gt;. Aston Martin is &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.astonmartin.com/en/live/news/2014/12/04/built-for-bond-aston-martin-debuts-unique-car-for-spectre"&gt;only making 10 DB10s&lt;/a&gt;, and none will be available for purchase by the public. It’s unclear what will happen to these cars once the movie wraps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DB10 is part of the wider trend of luxury brands going bespoke as people get richer globally, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://qz.com/302757/indias-super-rich-population-is-exploding/"&gt;most notably in China and India&lt;/a&gt;. A number of global luxury brands, including many car manufacturers (Ferrari, Maserati, even Harley-Davidson), are &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://economists-pick-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/International-Market-News/Mainland-Luxury-Consumers-Go-Bespoke-as-High-end-Market-Matures/imn/en/1/1X000000/1X09YKIU.htm"&gt;parading around specially made items&lt;/a&gt; as the super-rich around the world clamor for unique products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the rest of &lt;i&gt;Spectre&lt;/i&gt;‘s new human cast are pro wrestler and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; star Dave Bautista, &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;‘s Andrew Scott, Monica Bellucci, and Léa Seydoux. They’ll join Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, and Ben Whishaw from &lt;em&gt;Skyfall&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film will shoot in London, Rome, Mexico City, Morocco, and Austria. The title surely refers to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECTRE"&gt;SPECTRE&lt;/a&gt;, the supranational terrorist organization from the Bond universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Sam Mendes unveiling the Aston Martin DB10 at the Bond announcement event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool. Some of that I knew, and some I didn't. My favorite detail is how the placement of the barrel in the aging room can affect the flavor of the bourbon within. Just like cheese. (via &lt;a href="http://digg.com/"&gt;digg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">A couple of weeks ago, Techdirt &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141118/12135229182/eff-others-launch-new-free-security-certificate-authority-to-dramatically-increase-encrypted-internet-traffic.shtml"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting new project from the EFF, Mozilla and others to set up a free certificate authority (CA) that will allow anyone running a website to offer encrypted connections. That sounds like a great idea, since it will make snooping on web traffic much harder. But a post (on LinkedIn, unfortunately) by Alexander Hanff, Chief Privacy Officer at &lt;a href="http://www.connectinprivate.com/"&gt;Connect In Private&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141120073425-26662417-why-i-won-t-be-using-let-s-encrypt-and-recommend-other-not-to-also"&gt;wonders if it might actually make things worse&lt;/a&gt;. Here's why: &lt;i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Creating a new Super Certificate Authority is the equivalent of painting a huge red target onto the backs of all the people who use it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Let's not mix our words here, it will become a target -- that much is completely indisputable, it would be utterly naive to believe the US Government will not target this new CA with court orders. What's more, given the historical evidence, there is a strong chance that such orders will be for &amp;quot;super master keys&amp;quot; allowing them to pretend to be whomever they like [for &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130910/10470024468/flying-pig-nsa-is-running-man-middle-attacks-imitating-googles-servers.shtml"&gt;man-in-the-middle attacks&lt;/a&gt;] and it will be done under the guise of National Security because of course a CA which provides free certificates for everyone is (in the eyes of law enforcement) a hotbed for criminals and terrorists -- why on earth would a terrorist pay Verisign for an SSL certificate, leaving a paper trail, if they can obtain an anonymous certificate for free from Let's Encrypt?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Techdirt asked the EFF to respond to this concern, and Peter Eckersley, the organization's Technology Projects Director, replied as follows: &lt;i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr Hanff is right to be concerned about structural flaws in the CA infrastructure, but he hasn't understood the problem. This is something we've been working on for years: &lt;a href="https://eff.org/observatory"&gt;https://eff.org/observatory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VAreZZhue4"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VAreZZhue4&lt;/a&gt; and we certainly wouldn't have picked a design to make the situation worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Anyone who looks at the CA infrastructure is going to think, &amp;quot;oh, there are expensive high security CAs, and weaker low security CAs, and hundreds of others run by various corporations and governments, I'd better pick one I can trust&amp;quot;. But it turns out not to matter which one *you* pick, because our web browsers have been designed to trust hundreds of them. So even if you buy from the one with the best combination of security and jurisdictional robustness, a would-be man-in-the-middle attacker will pick a weak one to use against you. We've seen this play out for instance with the Iranian attack on Gmail via a CA in the Netherlands, and a Turkish CA issuing improper certs for Google. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Let's Encrypt's first mission will be to solve the grand problem of HTTPS, which is that hundreds of millions of sites don't use it at all. But it will also be engineered to begin addressing the structural flaws in the whole CA marketplace. For sites that it want it, we'll assist in using mechanisms like pinning to protect against the hundreds of other CAs that the site isn't using (pinning lets a site declare that only a small and specified number of CAs can sign certs for it). And for our own CA, we will use Certificate Transparency or equivalent mechanisms to ensure that if our operations were ever compromised or compelled in any way, that would be recorded and rapidly visible to the whole Internet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt; As that points out, the first problem is to get people using encrypted connections; after that, we need to work on those &amp;quot;structural flaws in the CA infrastructure&amp;quot; that Hanff and Eckersley agree are a serious issue that needs addressing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Follow me @glynmoody on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/glynmoody"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://identi.ca/glynmoody"&gt;identi.ca&lt;/a&gt;, and +glynmoody on &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+glynmoody"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141127/02534629263/will-new-free-certificate-authority-help-hinder-online-security.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141127/02534629263/will-new-free-certificate-authority-help-hinder-online-security.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141127/02534629263/will-new-free-certificate-authority-help-hinder-online-security.shtml?op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/41101710/sc/4/mf.gif" border="0"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/a2.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/214612336058/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/41101710/sc/4/a2t.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Backed by Skype co-founder Janus Friis and a team of tech veterans, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wire.com/"&gt;freshly launched Wire&lt;/a&gt; aims to be more than a regular chat service. It is a marriage of its competitors' most popular features, including the ability to &amp;quot;ping&amp;quot; contacts. In &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/03/wire-communications-skype-janus-friis-app"&gt;an interview with &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Skype co-founder and Wire investor Janus Friis remarks, &amp;quot;What attracted me to Wire is that it is something truly new. This is not some marginal improvement. This is not just an app.&amp;quot; He then adds, &amp;quot;Skype was launched more than a decade ago. A lot has changed since then - we are all used to free calls and texting, and we have taken to carrying our computers in our pockets.&amp;quot; Friis says that now is the time to create &amp;quot;the best possible communication tools&amp;quot; that are as...&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Razor was the first hit toy of the new millennium. In 2000, Razor &lt;a href="http://www.razor.com/about-razor/corporate-history/"&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; 5 million scooters in just six months, and they were everywhere. On long-shadowed schoolyard evenings, all the cool kids would take turns on the scooters, testing out tricks and making skid marks on the pavement. Land a hella tight ollie, and you were a playground hero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's a statistic to pop that nostalgia bubble: Razor scooters and other &amp;quot;ride-on&amp;quot; toys sent 110,000 kids to the hospital in 2001, according to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://cpj.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/28/0009922814561353.abstract"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; report in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;. In 1999, that number was 25,000—a jump as extreme as any trick you could land on a Razor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the paper—a comprehensive crunch of 20 years of hospital data—149,000 kids go to the hospital every year for toy-related injuries. &amp;quot;On average in 2011,&amp;quot; the paper states, &amp;quot;a child received treatment in a U.S. ED [Emergency Department] for a toy-related injury every three minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By far, the most dangerous toy category in the analysis were ride-on toys like scooters, wagons, and electric-powered mini-cars (e.g., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/36221565?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;amp;adid=22222222227026276063&amp;amp;wl0=&amp;amp;wl1=g&amp;amp;wl2=c&amp;amp;wl3=42971930792&amp;amp;wl4=&amp;amp;wl5=pla&amp;amp;wl6=81463953392&amp;amp;veh=sem"&gt;one of these bad boys you always coveted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Number of Injuries Sustained by Children Ages 0-17, by Type of Toy (1999-2011)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height="304" alt="" width="570" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/12/chart/e21a3d1b1.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Data: &lt;em&gt;Clinical Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, Chart: &lt;em&gt;National Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most-common injuries from toys: falls (45.5 percent), collisions (22.2 percent), and foreign-body involvement (think ingestion, 10.9 percent). The risk of toy injury peaks at 2 years old, a fact that will shock no one. Boys are twice as likely to go to the hospital with toy injuries. Thankfully for boys, this gap decreases with age, disappearing around age 17. But who is playing with toys at age 17 anyway?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Toy-Related Injuries by Age Group and Gender (1999-2011)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height="320" alt="" width="388" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/12/toys/f1311315d.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Data: &lt;em&gt;Clinical Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, Chart: &lt;em&gt;National Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's more than just the ride-on toys that are potentially dangerous. Every year, James Swartz and his group W.A.T.C.H.—World Against Toys Causing Harm—release &lt;a href="http://toysafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10-Worst-Toys-2014-w-Photos.pdf"&gt;a list of the top 10&lt;/a&gt; most dangerous toys on the market. Swartz's late father, Ed, founded the organization in the '70s to raise awareness of the issues. As his father became more involved in advocacy, toys started disappearing from James's toy box as he grew up. &amp;quot;A lot of sweaters as gifts growing up,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The list isn't meant to single out manufacturers, Swartz says, but rather to give parents a general sense of what types of products to avoid. The big picture: &amp;quot;Don't assume toys are necessarily safe because they are appearing on toy shelves,&amp;quot; Swartz says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Consumer Product Safety Commission is the government agency in charge of overseeing toy hazards. &amp;quot;There are some consumer product categories where we are reactive, but when it comes to toys, it's the opposite—we're proactive,&amp;quot;  Scott Wolfson, communication director for the CPSC, writes in an email. &amp;quot;We do warehouse and retail inspections; we established the strongest and most comprehensive federal toy safety standard in the world.&amp;quot; Still, some problem toys (that aren't necessarily out of compliance with the regulations, but are still dangerous) make it through.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One ride-on toy has made the list this year—the Radio Flyer Ziggle. It's a four-wheeled, foot-powered cycle that warns, &amp;quot;never use near motor vehicles, streets, swimming pools, hills, steps, or sloped driveways.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you see that many warnings, it raises the question—how can this product be used safely?&amp;quot; Swartz says. Any wheeled toy with a low profile presents such hazards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also making the list this year are some obvious ones: a bow-and-arrow kit, a &amp;quot;pencil turned catapult,&amp;quot; a toy machine gun, a hammer for killing Orcs, and the enticingly named &amp;quot;bottle-rocket party.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there are some nonobvious toys on the list: a baby doll with an all-too-easily removed bow, a plush toy with long, unsecured hair. There's also an alphabet pull toy meant for toddlers on the list. The problem with the toy? It has a 20-inch-long rope. According to regulations, any toy intended for a crib cannot have a rope more than 12 inches long. Because the toy is labeled as a &amp;quot;pull toy&amp;quot; and not a &amp;quot;crib toy,&amp;quot; it skirts the regulation. Swartz warns that it is loopholes like these that create dangers that aren't obvious to parents, let alone their kids. (See the full list &lt;a href="http://toysafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10-Worst-Toys-2014-w-Photos.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Any item you give a kid could mean trouble, but parents should be aware that some categories of toys pose higher risks than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are hazards associated with a lot of items, no doubt about it,&amp;quot; Swartz says. &amp;quot;Parents have to be armed with the knowledge that they can make informed choices for their children.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article was originally published at &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/the-toys-that-send-kids-to-the-emergency-room/383383/"&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/the-toys-that-send-kids-to-the-emergency-room/383383/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625823/s/41174633/sc/14/mf.gif" border="0"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/a2.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/214612349109/u/49/f/625823/c/34375/s/41174633/sc/14/a2t.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/inLKkdwwHOk"&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Velvet Underground&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Velvet Underground—45th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Polydor/Universal Music Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.motherjones.com/files/VUprodshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the radical and overpowering &lt;em&gt;White Light/White Heat&lt;/em&gt;, the Velvet Underground's third, self-titled, album initially seemed like a lesser effort, but it has more than stood the test of time. With cofounder and main creative foil (or foe) John Cale out of the band, leader Lou Reed assumed complete control, crafting a set of relatively understated songs that range from rockin' (&amp;quot;What Goes On&amp;quot;) to surprisingly gentle (&amp;quot;After Hours&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At six discs, 65 tracks, and five hours of music, this behemoth collection offers plenty to savor (although casual fans might prefer the two-disc distillation). If three different mixes of the original album suggests overkill, the mono version does reveal different textures to the music, while a fourth disc of sessions for an abandoned fourth album contains a slew of genuine gems, including the raucous &amp;quot;I'm Gonna Move Right In,&amp;quot; a touching &amp;quot;She's My Best Friend,&amp;quot; and an early look at the Reed standard &amp;quot;Rock &amp;amp; Roll.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final two discs, featuring live performances from November 1969, are simply terrific, highlighted by the exuberant &amp;quot;We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together,&amp;quot; a 30-minute-plus take on &amp;quot;Sister Ray&amp;quot; and the anthemic &amp;quot;Sweet Jane.&amp;quot; Nearly a half-century later, the raw heart and tender soul of the Velvet Underground are wondrous indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

        <summary type="html">In her quest to keep bankers out of senior regulatory positions, the Massachusetts senator forgets that too few regulators actually understand what Wall Street is up to.&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fortune.com&amp;amp;blog=64089429&amp;amp;post=888207&amp;amp;subd=fortunedotcom&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Twice last month, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called for the White House to back away from, or rule out considering, nominating Wall Street insiders for senior regulatory positions. If this is the start of a crusade, it's a very bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest challenge facing financial regulators is the mind-numbing complexity of financial instruments. One big reason Wall Street has gotten away with so many shenanigans is that too few regulators understand what banks are up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the public hears a lot about the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington--and though it surely poses concerns--the senior positions at the top regulatory institutions are filled with people from public service backgrounds, with academics, and with economists who, in their prior jobs, were not primarily engaged in trading, or reading balance sheets, or evaluating financial risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the most part, when Wall Street was piling into mortgage securities, these regulators did not understand the risks. They may not understand the next time either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Washington is going to be effective at policing Wall Street, it needs to understand what Wall Street does. Franklin D. Roosevelt appreciated this--in a far less complex age--when he nominated Joseph P. Kennedy, a one-time stock market &amp;quot;pool&amp;quot; operator (basically a manipulator) to be the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Blunting criticism that he was putting a fox in charge of the henhouse, FDR reportedly said, &amp;quot;set a thief to catch a thief.&amp;quot; Kennedy got the message. He was a resolute chairman and established a solid reputation for the SEC that endured for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy was not an aberration. His most illustrious successor may have been Arthur Levitt, a one-time stockbroker and stock exchange chairman who was wise to the canny ways of his profession. Levitt sniffed out the simmering potential for conflicts of interest between auditors and public companies--though Congress wouldn't listen--and was ultimately proven right by the 2002 Arthur Andersen scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Christopher Cox, a lawyer and later a congressman, was an ineffective SEC chair. He was blindsided by the 2007 mortgage crisis and it was under his watch that the agency missed the Bernie Madoff scandal. One of the toughest regulators was Nicholas Brady, the head of a presidential commission and soon to be Secretary of Treasury, who courageously identified &amp;quot;portfolio insurance,&amp;quot; then a hot Wall Street product, for stoking the panic in the 1987 stock market crash. Also at the Treasury, I would argue that Hank Paulson, formerly head of Goldman Sachs &lt;span data-symbol="GS"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fortune.com/company/gs/"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;GS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;, responded swiftly and effectively to the 2008 meltdown; he was more forceful than either of his two immediate predecessors, who hailed from the aluminum and railroad industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a couple of practiced lenders would have been useful at the Federal Reserve--which utterly failed to appreciate the risks in the sub-prime mortgage bubble. Indeed, it seems incredible that during the run-up to the mortgage crisis, among the Fed's seven governors, only one had a background in private sector banking. (Another, Keven Warsh, had worked at Morgan Stanley &lt;span data-symbol="MS"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fortune.com/company/ms/"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;, but by the time he joined the Board the bubble was ready to burst.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to urge a blanket ban on industry outsiders. The lone Fed governor who sounded early alarms about the mortgage crisis was Edward Gramlich, a former economics professor. Nor is it to suggest (obviously) that bankers never get it wrong. But finance cannot be regulated without expertise. To blackball professionals seems dangerously na?ve. We should not forget that Paul Volcker, one of the best, and an impeccably ethical, Fed chief, was groomed at Chase Manhattan Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren is fighting to block Antonio F. Weiss, who has been nominated by President Obama to be the next Treasury under secretary for domestic finance. Though an important post, it's an obscure one to be the focus of a Congressional intervention--especially from a Senator of the President's own party. But Warren has made clear that one of her main objections is that Weiss works at Lazard, a Wall Street investment bank. She wrote in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-warren/presidents-wall-street-nominee_b_6188324.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that Obama should &amp;quot;loosen the hold that Wall Street banks have over economic policy-making.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That article followed closely a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-and-joe-manchin-the-fed-needs-governors-who-arent-wall-street-insiders-1416269808"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;op-ed, in which Warren and a fellow Democratic Senator called on President Obama to &amp;quot;move in a new direction&amp;quot; by filling the two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board with nominees who will &amp;quot;look out for Main Street, not the big banks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain, as Warren did, that Wall Street has a &amp;quot;hold&amp;quot; over the Treasury is a curious reading of recent history. Of the eight U.S. Treasury secretaries since the beginning of the Clinton Administration, only three have come from Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if Warren thinks nominating Fed governors sensitive to Main Street represents a &amp;quot;new direction,&amp;quot; she is dead wrong. Only one of the five Fed governors worked as private sector bankers. All of the rest are from public service or academia. Even among the Federal Reserve Banks, the level at which most of the supervision occurs, only three of the 12 have presidents who worked in private sector finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Warren's objections, it's perhaps surprising that, last year, she voted to approve Jack Lew as Treasury Secretary (Lew was at Citigroup &lt;span data-symbol="C"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fortune.com/company/c/"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; when the bank collapsed and required a bailout). But that's the point: Wall Street-ers should be evaluated on their merits, just like others. Wall Street experience is certainly not a qualification in itself--nominees must demonstrate that they can separate from their employers, intellectually as well as financially. But nor should it be a disqualification. It wouldn't hurt to have a few foxes on the lookout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roger Lowenstein is the author, most recently, of The End of Wall Street. He is writing a book on the origins of the U.S. Federal Reserve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated that none of the five U.S. Fed governors worked as private sector bankers. Jerome H. Powell was a partner at The Carlyle Group from 1997 to 2005.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fortune.com&amp;amp;blog=64089429&amp;amp;post=888207&amp;amp;subd=fortunedotcom&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/fortunebrainstormtech/~4/kEN-WiGcj6o"&gt;</content>

As he explained in our conversation in this series, he writes for feeling rather than flashy plot. Using a passage from Georges Perec’s &lt;em&gt;A Man Asleep&lt;/em&gt;, Stamm praised smallness: The best literature, as he sees it, is humble, rooted in the everyday, and based on looking very closely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not that Stamm eschews drama altogether—he only looks for it in unexpected places. &lt;em&gt;All Days Are Night&lt;/em&gt; hinges on a fatal crash: A couple gets into a fight at a boozy party, and they wreck the car on the way home. The husband, the driver, is killed. The wife, a television host, suffers a crueler fate: She’s disfigured beyond recognition—an ear torn away, her nose gone. But Stamm refuses to derive tension from flying sparks and tearing steel; he gives the accident just one fleeting description, and works its aftermath instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;em&gt;All Days Are Night&lt;/em&gt;, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann, Stamm is the author of three previous novels and two story collections. In 2013, he was shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize; his stories appear in venues such as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;A Public Space&lt;/em&gt;. He spoke to me by phone from his home in Winterthur, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Stamm: &lt;/strong&gt;Georges Perec’s &lt;em&gt;A Man Asleep &lt;/em&gt;is a very simple book, and that’s probably why I like it. It’s about a student who skips a test he has to take. That’s where the book starts: He simply doesn’t show up for the test. From there, he realizes he doesn’t really have to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; he doesn’t want to do. He slowly withdraws from his life and responsibilities, reveling in the fantasy that doing so makes him special, maybe a genius. In a way, he stops living all together, doing very little besides eating the same things every day and reading the paper from beginning to end. He does this for a long time, until the very end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think, once, when I was younger, I was maybe a little bit like this guy: this young man who seems to be untouchable, so indifferent, who tries to refuse to be a part of everything around him. I recognize, in his gesture, the way I was when I was 20 years old and just starting to write for the first time. Back then, I wanted to be the wise author who is somehow above everything, who somehow understands everything. I wanted to write great books, books that achieved deep insights about the world and showed other people how to live. (Maybe it’s a Swiss thing: The Swiss seem to always think they are extremely special—that we are the chosen people, somehow.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But then things happened in my life—thankfully—that knocked me from my post. Having children, for example. When I had children, I realized that some points of view weren’t possible anymore. This whole heroic author routine—the literary genius who is above everything—well, that seemed ridiculous when you were changing diapers. It grounded me somehow. I started to realize that, despite my pretensions, I was really just like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is also what happens to the main character in &lt;em&gt;A Man Asleep&lt;/em&gt;: He finds out he’s just a normal guy. It happens in the book’s wonderful final pages. I’ve now read the novel in three languages—and the last section works in English, French, and German. It’s just very beautiful. The narrator, addressing the main character as “you”—as he does throughout the novel—berates him for his show of independence, of being above the crowd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have learnt nothing, except that solitude teaches you nothing, except that indifference teaches you nothing: it was a lure, it was a mesmerizing illusion which concealed a pitfall. You were alone and that is all there is to it and you wanted to protect yourself; you wanted to burn the bridges between you and the world once and for all. But you are such a negligible speck, and the world is such big word: all you ever did was to drift around a city, to walk a few kilometers past facades, parks, and embankments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here, the narrator calls out his character’s routine for what it is: a facade born out of insecurity and loneliness. All the acts of rebellion and put-on eccentricities were part of a sad charade—no better, in the end, than a purposeless kind of drifting. The whole act was merely a “mesmerizing illusion” designed to distract the character from his own insignificance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The narrator goes on to enumerate the ways that the character is conventional, mediocre, unoriginal. The narrator even suggests it would be better if the young man had some kind of deformity. “If you were ugly, your ugliness might perhaps be fascinating,” he writes, “but you are not even ugly, neither are you a hunchback, a stammerer, an amputee, a legless cripple, and you don’t even limp.” Any of these conditions might save him from being wholly unremarkable—but, alas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet it’s not some huge moment that reveals this essential sameness to the character, that proves he’s forever part of the crowd. He never sees god, or whatever. Instead it’s a dumb little thing: He realizes he doesn’t want to get wet when it rains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, you are not the nameless master of the world, the one on whom history had lost its hold, the one who no longer felt the rain falling … You are no longer the inaccessible, the limpid, the transparent one. You are afraid, you are waiting. You are waiting, on Place Clichy, for the rain to stop falling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here, he’s part of society, part of all the people who are standing around waiting for the rain to stop. Like all human beings, he wants to avoid getting wet. Like everyone else, he huddles under the awnings and archways of Paris as soon as the skies open up. To me, it’s a beautiful image, much deeper than the “big” moment somehow. And the smallness of the image—the everyday nature of this revelation—perhaps undercuts the character’s own grandiose ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s good for artists to have this kind of humility in mind. It’s good for you to realize you’re not immortal. You’re part of society. You might be forgotten. Delusions of grandeur probably make work easier—but it makes your work &lt;em&gt;deeper&lt;/em&gt; if you admit you’re not so special. It made writing more difficult for me to be grounded, but on the other hand, I think my writing became more substantial when I realized I am no better than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it can be hard to come to this conclusion, especially for young people. There’s so much vanity in literature and all the arts. You see this all the time—take Hemingway, for example, who played the big-game hunter. This whole bullshit about hunting and bullfighting and fishing: That was just the image he wanted us to have of him. Maybe it helped him to feel that way. But it’s not a very mature thing to do. It does not help us understand the work at all—in fact, I think that kind of posturing ruins the work for some people. You can always read the books, in any case, and the persona recedes to the background. When you read Hemingway’s books, it’s there on the page: He wasn’t just the strong guy. He was a hardworking, serious artist, who felt things very deeply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can’t just blame the artist, though: We half expect our cultural figures to be these larger-than-life, romantic archetypes. We don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; them to be, but we want them to be. People want artists to be vain—it probably serves their own vanity, in a way. As long as you’re honest in your texts, it doesn’t do any major harm—but it’s still quite infantile. I think it’s best for writers to strive to be mature, as much as they can, in their life and work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think this authorial tendency to self-dramatize can be seen inside some works, too—so many writers seem to need to pump their stories full of sound and fury. I think, instead, of Perec—and the amazing maturity he displays by not reaching for the big, dramatic moment. There tends to be so much drama in writing—too much, in my opinion. I’m just now reading a collection of short stories, and in every short story there’s a suicide or a murder or a rape. Many writers feel that they have to put all this drama in their books in order for us to &lt;em&gt;feel &lt;/em&gt;something. Drama is always too easy, in a way. It’s easier just to bring the big drama into things. Especially with young authors, you see so many texts that are just so filled with stuff: You think, get rid of all this! You don’t need that. The young woman I was telling you about, she’s a very good writer. But the book would be much better with fewer &lt;em&gt;deaths&lt;/em&gt;. She seems to rely on them, but she doesn’t need them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To me, though, it’s much more interesting to deal with everyday life, with novelty, with days going by and nothing changing. It’s more difficult, but it’s more interesting—because that’s what most of our lives are. Ninety-nine percent of our days are like the day before. It’s very seldom that we kill ourselves, that we are raped, or killed—luckily. For me, the interesting thing is to deal with that head-on: How do we live when nothing is changing? How do we deal with small things?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is one reason I love a short paragraph from the end of &lt;em&gt;A Man Asleep&lt;/em&gt;, so much so that I borrowed a line as a title for one of our books:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is on a day like this one, a little later, a little earlier, that everything starts again, that everything starts, that everything continues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can still achieve emotional impact without big, dramatic gestures. It’s done by watching very carefully. It’s like when I went to the forest with my children. The first time you say: There’s the trees. But then, you go deeper. You start looking at the individual plants, seeing how different they all are. In one square foot of forest, you can find 20 different species. And that means 20 different types of leaves, and 20 different forms of reproduction, and so on, and suddenly things are very interesting. When you start just explaining and watching closely, a great deal can happen in a very small space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying nothing should happen in stories. I do like events—but the most interesting events are the small ones. Mrs. Dalloway going to buy some flowers for a party. Or, the Raymond Carver story “Viewfinder,” which starts this way: “A man without hands came to the door to sell me a photograph of my house.” The story shifts in a moment when the handicapped man takes a picture of the narrator—you can feel that it changes her life, somehow. But it’s not a big event. The big events—when someone dies, for example—they often &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; really change our lives. They are too big, somehow. And our reactions are usually paradoxical to them: we actually feel less than we think we should. So often, it’s the strange, small details that stay with us instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I wrote the story &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/14/sweet-dreams"&gt;“Sweet Dreams,”&lt;/a&gt; which was published recently in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, I told my editor, “I’m writing a story about a woman who buys a corkscrew.” And that’s all it is: She buys a corkscrew and shows it to her boyfriend. But in this moment, you can feel that many things happen. You can see the whole relationship in this thing. Your DNA is in every cell. You can find the DNA of this relationship in this very small cell, where she’s buying a corkscrew. I don’t need the big drama. I don’t need the main characters to fight and kill each other to see who they really are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can somehow feel which moments are important. Even in your own life, you can feel when things are important if you’re attentive enough. I’m not looking for them. But once in three months, when I see something or read something or encounter something, I have this feeling: &lt;em&gt;That’s something important. &lt;/em&gt;Those are the things I write about. Very often, I don’t know why what I saw or read or experienced is important. I just know that there’s something there that I want to explore on the page. Sometimes, as I start writing, I discover what drew me to my subject. Sometimes, I don’t find out until after I’ve written the text and I re-read it a few times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This feeling of intuition guides me more than any sense of structure or plot. I’m completely against the idea that you should know you character’s whole background, or whole biography, before you begin. I think that’s just nonsense. That’s how you make movies in Hollywood, but that’s not how you make art. You find out about your person by writing about them. You need to relate to them: have feelings for them, love them, hate them. Start writing. Find out about your setting by writing about it, too. I compare the process to an expedition sometimes: It’s like going into the wild and seeing where you get. Sometimes you don’t find your way and you have to turn back. Sometimes you find something incredible: America, or India, or the source of the Nile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t structure. I think I’ve developed a feeling for form just by writing for 30 years now that I can feel—even without knowing where I’m going—which way could be a good way. I sometimes introduce minor characters without knowing what they are for, and later I realized they’re important to the text. I don’t want to mystify the whole thing, but most decisions really are by feeling and intuition. I did read some crime novels when I was 20 or something, but even then I got tired of the whole plot thing. I came to George Simenon, where he gives us the information in the very beginning, and it’s not about plot any more. You always know who murdered the guy. It’s about how Commissaire Maigret figures it out. I think plot has always not been too interesting to me. If you can be open and rely on your feelings somehow, and let them guide you—not look for the bestseller, or whatever—then something good might happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The readers can feel the writer’s genuine interest, and they care more about locating that interest than they do about the machinations of plot. They are not stupid. I want to go hand in hand with my reader, to explore something together with him or her. And that’s more interesting, because I think the reader can feel my interest in the subject. But if he knows that I’m just god who sits somewhere on the throne and decides what I should tell him and what not, it’s not really a good relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think entertainment isn’t the goal of literature. I’m not against entertainment—I like, say, James Bond movies or &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt;. But I separate them from movies like Richard Linklater’s movies, which make me see things differently. To me—I’m not a religious person, so I have always looked for meaning in books. For me, literature must be more than entertainment: It’s the place where I was look for meaning and insight. Literature started as religious texts, after all. And then somehow we reduced god, and now it’s just literature left. It’s the same with images. When you see images in a cave that are 30,000 years old, it’s not about painting a bull or a tiger, but there is much more to it: These illustrations are explorations of the world and the way it works. Literature to me has always been like that. It’s about relating to the world and trying to understand it. When I want to be entertained I’ll watch a film on DVD. When I read, I’m looking for something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we speak, I’m looking at maybe a thousand books. I have the authors A - H downstairs in my living room, the rest upstairs. I can see Camus, Richard Ford, Don DeLillo, all kinds of wonderful authors. Each volume is like a different being somehow. Each one is a different world. Sometimes it’s a memory of who you were when you read them—Hemingway reminds me of when I was 20, how much I learned from him as I was just starting to write. Sometimes it’s a feeling—I love Don DeLillo for the way he seems to be unsure where he’s going, the way he’s willing to experiment and try things out. Reading a good book is like meeting a real person. You relate to a book, just the way you can relate to a flesh-and-blood individual. It’s so much more than just spending time. You’ll never be the same after you’ve read a really good book—you experience something almost like life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article was originally published at &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/by-heart/383341/"&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/by-heart/383341/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625828/s/411442e6/sc/38/mf.gif" border="0"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/a2.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/214612335704/u/49/f/625828/c/34375/s/411442e6/sc/38/a2t.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticCulture/~4/K2jufO_BX3s"&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is right back to acting as stalwart ally to a repressive and incredibly violent dictator sitting in Cairo doing its bidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/12/03/us-supported-egypt-188-protesters-sentenced-die-days-mubarak-freed/"&gt;In US-Supported Egypt, 188 Protesters Are Sentenced to Die Days After Mubarak is Effectively Freed&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept"&gt;The Intercept&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since &lt;span&gt;then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led a coup against the country’s elected president, Mohamed Morsi, the coup regime has become increasingly repressive, brutal and lawless. Despite that, or perhaps because of it, the Obama administration has become &lt;a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/02/feigned-american-support-egyptian-democracy-lasted-roughly-six-weeks/"&gt;increasingly supportive&lt;/a&gt; of the despot in Cairo, plying his regime with massive amounts of &lt;a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/04/24/225464_egypt-aid-by-the-numbers.html?rh=1"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=123223"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and praising him (in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/world/middleeast/egypt-warns-morsi-supporters-to-end-protests.html"&gt;words of John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;) for “restoring democracy.” Following recent meetings with Sisi &lt;a href="http://egyptianstreets.com/2014/09/23/egypts-president-sisi-meets-top-us-politicians-former-secretaries-of-state/"&gt;by Bill and Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above), and then Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright, Obama &lt;a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/obama-meets-with-el-sissi-says-egypt-key-to-mideast-security/"&gt;himself met&lt;/a&gt; with the dictator in late September and “&lt;span&gt;touted the longstanding relationship between the United States and Egypt as a cornerstone of American security policy in the Middle East.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this occurs even as, in the words of a June &lt;a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/09/egypt-new-leader-faces-rights-crisis"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Human Rights Watch,&lt;span&gt; the Sisi era has included the “worst incident of mass unlawful killings in Egypt’s recent history” and “judicial authorities have handed down unprecedented large-scale death sentences and security forces have carried out mass arrests and torture that harken back to the darkest days of former President Hosni Mubarak’s rule.” &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/opinion/sunday/reining-in-egypts-military-aid.html"&gt;editorialized&lt;/a&gt; last month that “Egypt today is in many ways more repressive than it was during the darkest periods of the reign of deposed strongman Hosni Mubarak.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As heinous as it has been, the Sisi record has worsened considerably in the last week. On Friday, an Egyptian court &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/29/us-egypt-mubarak-verdict-idUSKCN0JD05M20141129"&gt;dismissed all charges&lt;/a&gt; against the previous U.S.-supported Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak stemming from the murder of 239 democracy protesters in 2011. The ruling also cleared his interior minister and six other aides. It also cleared him and his two sons of corruption charges, while upholding a corruption charge that will almost certainly entail no further prison time. The ruling was &lt;a href="http://www.madamasr.com/sections/politics/why-everyone-walked-free-mubarak-trial"&gt;based&lt;/a&gt; on a mix of conspiracy theories and hyper-technical and highly dubious legal findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Mubarak and his cronies are immunized for their savage crimes, 188 members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who participated in anti-Sisi protests that led to the deaths of 11 police officers, were handed death sentences today &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;the New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/world/middleeast/egypt-sentences-nearly-200-to-die-in-mass-trial-over-killings-of-police.html"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, it was “the third such mass sentencing in less than a year,” and was handed down despite “no effort to prove that any individual defendant personally killed any of the officers; that more than 100 of the defendants were not allowed to have lawyers; and that scores of defense witnesses were excluded from the courtroom.” The judge ordering these mass executions was the same cretinous judicial officer who, over the summer, &lt;a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/egypt-finds-al-jazeera-journalists-guilty-201462373539293797.html"&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; three Al Jazeera journalists to seven to ten years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications are obvious. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; today &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/03/us-egypt-mubarak-justice-idUSKCN0JH13N20141203?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=topNews&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Mubarak acquittal is widely seen as the final proof of the full return of the Mubarak era, as the crushing of the 2011 revolution. Political Science Professor As’ad AbuKhalil &lt;a href="http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/mubarak%E2%80%99s-verdict-ancien-arab-regimes-new-regimes"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt;, convincingly, that re-imposing dictatorial rule in Egypt to mercilessly crush the Muslim Brotherhood is what the U.S., Israel and the Saudi-led Gulf monarchs have craved since the unrest in 2011. With the Gulf monarch’s rift with Brotherhood-supporting Qatar &lt;a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/11/16/uk-gulf-summit-ambassadors-idUKKCN0J00Y220141116"&gt;now resolved&lt;/a&gt;, all relevant powers are united behind full restoration of the tyranny that controlled Egypt for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the political meaning, the two starkly different judicial rulings &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/world/middleeast/egypt-sentences-nearly-200-to-die-in-mass-trial-over-killings-of-police.html"&gt;demonstrate&lt;/a&gt; that judicial independence in Egypt is a farce, that courts are blatantly used for political ends to serve the interests of the regime, harshly punishing its political opponents and protecting its allies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rights advocates argued that the juxtaposition — hyper-scrupulousness in the case of the former president, a rush to the gallows for the Islamist defendants — captured the systematic bias of the Egyptian courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is just one more piece of evidence that the judiciary is just a political tool the government uses to prosecute its enemies and free the people it wants to be freed,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East and North Africa director of the nonprofit group Human Rights Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, it would be nice for the U.S. Government to condemn all of this, and even better if they cut off support for the regime as punishment. But in another, more meaningful sense, such denunciation would be ludicrous, given what enthusiastic practitioners U.S. officials are of similar methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully protecting high-level lawbreakers – even including torturers and war criminals – is an Obama specialty, a vital aspect of his legacy. A &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/07/04/two_tiered_justice/"&gt;two-tiered justice system&lt;/a&gt; – where the &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/04/14/justice_10/"&gt;most powerful financial and political criminals are fully shielded&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2009/01/28/prosecutions_3/"&gt;ordinary crimes are punished with repugnant harshness&lt;/a&gt; – is the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/12/hsbc-prosecution-fine-money-laundering"&gt;very definition&lt;/a&gt; of the American judicial process, which imprisons &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/the-caging-of-america"&gt;more of its ordinary citizens&lt;/a&gt; than any other country in the world, even as it fully immunizes its most powerful actors for &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/09/no-charges-destruction-cia-interrogation-tapes"&gt;far more egregious crimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in justifying his refusal to condemn the dropping of charges against Mubarak, Sisi seemed to take a page from Obama’s own rhetorical playbook. Egypt must “look to the future” and “cannot ever go back,” he &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/opinion/in-egypt-a-verdict-turns-back-the-clock.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; when cynically invoking judicial independence as his reason for not condemning the pro-Mubarak ruling. The parallels to &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;Obama’s own justifications&lt;/a&gt; for not prosecuting U.S. torturers and other war criminals – “&lt;span&gt;we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards”&lt;/span&gt; - are self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be true that U.S. courts don’t simultaneously sentence hundreds of political protesters to die &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;, but the U.S. government is in no position to lecture anyone on the indiscriminate and criminal use of violence for political ends. As of today, Obama officials can &lt;a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2014/11/21/americas-500th-drone-strike/"&gt;officially celebrate&lt;/a&gt; the War on Terror’s 500th targeted killing far from any battlefield (450 of which occurred under Obama), strikes which have &lt;span&gt;killed an estimated 3,674 people&lt;/span&gt;. As CFR’s Micah Zenko put it, “&lt;span&gt;it is easy to forget that this tactic, envisioned to be rare and used exclusively for senior al-Qaeda leaders thirteen years ago, has become a completely accepted and routine foreign policy activity.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Condemnation of Egyptian tyranny has always been an uncomfortable matter for U.S. officials given how they &lt;a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/egypt0505/4.htm#_Toc102563432"&gt;long used Mubarak’s favorite torturers&lt;/a&gt; to extract information from detainees in their custody. Indeed, once Mubarak’s downfall became inevitable, the Obama administration &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/02/08/suleiman/"&gt;worked to ensure&lt;/a&gt; that his replacement would be the CIA’s long-time torturing and rendition partner, close Mubarak ally Omar &lt;span&gt;Suleiman. And, just by the way, the U.S. also &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/17/sami-al-haj-al-jazeera-guantanamo-bay-journalist"&gt;imprisoned an Al Jazeera journalist – in Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt; - for seven years until casually letting him go as though nothing had happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like just yesterday that American media outlets were pretending to be on the side of the Tahrir Square demonstrates, all while suppressing the unpleasant fact that the dictator against which they were marching was one of the U.S. government’s longest and closest allies, a murderous tyrant about whom Hillary Clinton &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/01/secretary-clinton-in-2009-i-really-consider-president-and-mrs-mubarak-to-be-friends-of-my-family/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “&lt;span&gt;I really consider President and Mrs. Mubarak to be friends of my family.” It’s an extraordinary feat of propaganda that all of that has been washed away – again – and the U.S. is right back to acting as stalwart ally to a repressive and incredibly violent dictator sitting in Cairo doing its bidding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="html">MLB Trade Value, Part 1</title>
        <published>2014-12-03T06:14:52Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">With the hot stove smoking and the winter meetings looming, it’s time for our annual ranking of baseball’s 50 most valuable assets.&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&amp;amp;blog=60203239&amp;amp;post=195426&amp;amp;subd=espngrantland&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; thousand years from now, when historians look back at the 2014 MLB season and its ties to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq1d07gYl8o"&gt;next big thing&lt;/a&gt;, they’ll focus on two turning points. First, they’ll commemorate &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2014-mlb-playoffs-san-francisco-giants-win-world-series-madison-bumgarner-kansas-city-royals/"&gt;the third&lt;/a&gt; of 50 World Series that the even-year overlord Giants will win over the course of a century. Second, they’ll reflect on Tommy John surgery reaching its peak before giving way to the golden age of pitcher health — and world peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Giants and the Tommy John epidemic have already left lasting impressions in the present day. This was the year that Madison Bumgarner ascended from staff ace to all-time postseason legend, and the year that T.J. surgeries piled up &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/matt-moore-baseball-tommy-john-surgery-historic-rate/"&gt;at a record pace&lt;/a&gt;, felling many of baseball’s brightest young arms. Both occurrences helped spark a big change in the way we view the league’s best players and most valuable commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click here for Part 2 of the 2014 MLB Trade Value column.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on that note, welcome to the third edition of Grantland’s MLB Trade Value, where we’ll try to answer the question that hangs over so many sports debates: Would you trade&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;guy for&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;guy? More than simply listing the best current players with the best current stats, this ranking seeks to account for multiple other factors. Talent and track record matter, but so do age, health, and contract status. The perfect Trade Value player is an established star who’s still young enough to carry growth potential, has no significant injury history,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has an affordable contract that brings numerous years of team control. Ultimately, this is a thought experiment: If every team made every player available via trade, which guys would fetch the greatest return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;h4&gt;More Trade Value Rankings&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/nba-trade-value/"&gt;Bill Simmons on the NBA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/nfl-trade-value/"&gt;Bill Barnwell on the NFL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/mlb-trade-value/"&gt;Jonah Keri on MLB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/trade-value/"&gt;All Trade Value!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;While we’ve used rigorous statistical analysis to help find the answers, this remains a subjective exercise. For instance, when considering the trade value of a 22-year-old mega-prospect with six years of controllable service time (three at the league-minimum salary) versus that of a 10-year veteran who’s widely regarded as the best pitcher in his league and who’s owed nearly $26 million a year for the next five seasons, the answer is in the eye of the beholder. A rebuilding or low-revenue club might jump at the chance to land Kris Bryant, while a richer team gearing up for a playoff push would have a tough time turning down Felix Hernandez.
&lt;p&gt;We’ll do our best to balance all of those factors. We’ll also acknowledge the growing trend of small- and mid-market teams &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/opportunity-knocks-and-opportunity-costs-for-cain-and-votto/"&gt;locking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/mariners-open-the-vault-for-king-felix/"&gt;up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/giancarlo-stanton-miami-marlins-13-year-325-million-contract/"&gt;young stars&lt;/a&gt;, the resulting thinning of the free-agent market, and the corresponding spike in demand for elite players. We’ll call on conversations with executives and talent evaluators from across the sport. And we’ll prepare to read all the hate mail you send to &lt;a target="_blank" href="mailto:grantlandfantasy@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;span&gt;grantlandfantasy@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for the first time, we’ll make minor leaguers eligible for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with a nod to Grantland Trade Value brothers-in-arms &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/nba-trade-value-part-1-2/"&gt;Bill Simmons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-nfl-trade-value-part-1-50-assets/"&gt;Bill Barnwell&lt;/a&gt;, let’s do this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trade Value Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Contracts matter. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Price is a better pitcher than Yordano Ventura, but Price will be eligible for free agency at the end of the 2015 season, while Ventura isn’t even arbitration-eligible yet and will be under team control through 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Age matters. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jose Bautista and Giancarlo Stanton put up similar numbers in 2014, but Bautista is 34 and, as great as he is now, probably won’t be great for too many more years. Stanton is 25 and just starting to harness the full scope of his powers, so he has more trade value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. It’s all relative. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If every team started shopping every player as a trade candidate, which guys would attract the biggest return from any of the other 29 clubs? For instance, if we’re comparing the trade value of Manny Machado and Troy Tulowitzki, we’re not concerned that the Rockies have a solid third baseman of their own in Nolan Arenado, or that the Orioles already have a capable shortstop in J.J. Hardy.&lt;a data-footnote-id="12" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/#fn-12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Instead, we want to know this: If every team were allowed to bid on Machado and Tulo, which player would net the greater return?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Positional scarcity matters. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If a shortstop and first baseman put up comparable offensive numbers, the shortstop is the more valuable player, since it’s much tougher to find someone with the defensive chops to handle short than one who can man first. That’s already accounted for in the Wins Above Replacement metric, which you’ll see referenced occasionally here, but it bears repeating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Defense, park factors, and other variables not immediately apparent in superficial stats matter. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These are not fantasy baseball rankings, so a player who hits 30 home runs isn’t necessarily more valuable than one who hits 20, or even five.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The list runs in reverse order. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If Yu Darvish is no. 17 on this list, it means the Rangers likely wouldn’t trade him for anyone ranked 18 to 50, but would have to at least consider swapping him for the players ranked 16 to 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All contract figures are via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/cots/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cot’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;See Ya: Players Who Fell Out of the Top 50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="matt-carpenter-cardinals" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/matt-carpenter-cardinals.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to this year’s list, here’s a quick rundown of the players we ranked last year (&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-2/"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;) who failed to make the cut again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan Braun (no. 50 last year)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;was the most divisive player on the 2013 list following his PED suspension, and whether due to a comedown, injuries, random variance, or all of the above, he wasn’t the same player in 2014 … &lt;strong&gt;Jean Segura&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(49) &lt;/strong&gt;posted a .325/.363/.487 first half and .241/.268/.315 second half in 2013, and the latter proved to be far more predictive … &lt;strong&gt;Adrian Beltre (46)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-often-underappreciated-adrian-beltre/"&gt;a future Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with a legendary fear of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/384851/BeltreHead.gif"&gt;having his head touched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and he barely missed the cut this time despite being 35 and having only one year (plus a vesting option) left on his contract … &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlos Santana (45)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is a valuable hitter even when he bats just .231, and he has a very favorable contract, but an influx of younger talent knocked him off the list …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay Bruce (43)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;was the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=21,a"&gt;fourth-worst&lt;/a&gt; full-time player by WAR in 2014 …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian Desmond (42)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;will be a free agent after the 2015 season …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gio Gonzalez (41)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is no longer cheap …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick Corbin (40)&lt;/strong&gt;, well, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/70090028/ace-lefty-corbin-has-tommy-john-surgery"&gt;oy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Carpenter (37)&lt;/strong&gt;, arguably the toughest omission of all, is a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/how-matt-carpenter-destroyed-the-dodgers/"&gt;pitch-spoiling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=14,d"&gt;on-base&lt;/a&gt; machine, one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/batting/_/sort/pitchesPerPlateAppearance/type/expanded/order/true"&gt;the toughest&lt;/a&gt; outs in the game, and under team control through 2020 (including an option year); he also slugged .375 last season and will be just shy of 35 years old when his contract ends … &lt;strong&gt;Matt Moore (34)&lt;/strong&gt; missed most of the year following Tommy John but has such a team-friendly contract that he could claw his way back onto this list next year … &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurickson Profar&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(32)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; boasts an enviable &lt;/span&gt;combination of talent, youth, and affordability, but lost his season to a nasty shoulder injury …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Price (30)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;will be a free agent at season’s end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clayton Kershaw (29)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is still a highly desirable commodity despite the $193 million owed to him over the next six years, but the clause in his contract that grants him free-agency rights at year’s end if he’s traded in-season or the same rights at the end of a full campaign if he’s dealt in the offseason substantially undercut his trade value … &lt;strong&gt;Chris Davis (28)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;just hit .196 …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Verlander (27)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;isn’t Justin Verlander anymore, and paying him $28 million a year over the next five seasons could be a real burden …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Kipnis (25)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is just 27 years old and a good bet to bounce back in 2015, but his 2014 was ugly … &lt;strong&gt;Carlos Gonzalez (24)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;got hurt, &lt;em&gt;again &lt;/em&gt;…&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wil Myers (23)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;regressed badly as a sophomore, but as with Kipnis, we should expect better things ahead … &lt;strong&gt;Dustin Pedroia (22)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; knows that the Red Sox want him to be a lifer, but &lt;/span&gt;that emotional attachment can’t mask his alarming slugging average trend (.493 to .474 to .449 to .415 to .376 over the past five seasons) or the fact that his insistence on playing through injuries, while admirable, hasn’t always helped his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wright (19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;turns 32 later this month and hit eight home runs last season; while he’ll probably knock more balls out of the reconfigured Citi Field next year, he’s no longer a huge bargain … &lt;strong&gt;Miguel Cabrera (9)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is still &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/cabrera-continues-to-make-history/"&gt;an absolute joy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to watch as he &lt;/span&gt;pummels baseballs; his new contract, however, will eventually prove to be &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/detroit-tigers-sign-miguel-cabrera-to-historic-contract/"&gt;an absolute nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Year’s Honorable Mentions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="jacob-degrom-mets" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/jacob-degrom-mets.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim McIsaac/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Todd Frazier (Not Ranked), 3B, Cincinnati Reds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Like Carpenter, Frazier is an excellent hitter at a position light on them. He’s also arbitration-eligible for the first time this winter and under team control for three more years. Kyle Seager just got a $100 million contract from the Mariners, and it’s fair to argue that he, Carpenter, and Frazier, three fairly comparable players, should all be grouped together instead of strewn across three categories. But no one said this was fair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Cobb (Honorable Mention), SP, Tampa Bay Rays; Lance Lynn (NR), SP, St. Louis Cardinals; Tyson Ross (NR), SP, San Diego Padres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; All three of these excellent pitchers are under team control through 2017. A handful of players cracked the top 50 despite offering only two years of control, and it’d be fair to argue that the extra year should count for more. But the gap between nos. 75 and 36 on this list is much narrower than the gap between nos. 35 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob deGrom (NR), SP, New York Mets; Garrett Richards (NR), SP, Los Angeles Angels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; It takes a hell of a lot for a pitcher to make the top 50. DeGrom set the league on fire as a rookie, posting a 2.69 ERA and striking out more than a batter per inning. But hitters &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=140&amp;amp;type=2&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=5,d"&gt;cracked more line drives&lt;/a&gt; off him than against all but 11 pitchers with at least 140 innings, and his minor league track record isn’t nearly as impressive as what he did in 2014. Richards, meanwhile, was easily one of the 10 best starters in the AL on a per-inning basis, and he owns an electric, high-90s fastball that can be nearly unhittable. But he wrecked his knee late in the season, casting some doubt on his ability to be as dominant in 2015, and he’s a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/library/business/super-two/"&gt;Super Two&lt;/a&gt; player who’s arbitration-eligible for the first time this offseason. This might seem like nitpicking, but considering what happened to young stalwarts like Jose Fernandez, Moore, Jarrod Parker, Corbin, and Richards in 2014, it’s also a reminder of how tough it is for pitchers to excel year in and year out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose Quintana (NR), SP, Chicago White Sox; Chris Archer (NR), SP, Tampa Bay Rays; Marcus Stroman (NR), SP, Toronto Blue Jays:&lt;/strong&gt; These three came even closer to making the top 50, with Quintana and Archer signed to incredibly cheap contracts and Stroman posting numbers that rivaled deGrom’s (on a fielding-independent basis) while carrying a better pedigree, being three years younger, and succeeding in the AL. Archer in particular got multiple endorsements from MLB talent evaluators, with one describing him as “young, athletic, cheap, and signed to an extremely reasonable contract,” and another saying, “He fits in the 40-50 range for me with the contract and the stuff.” We just couldn’t find room for them, nor for 2014 breakout pitchers Dallas Keuchel, Matt Shoemaker, Collin McHugh, Phil Hughes, and 10 other names you’re probably shouting at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some rapid-fire comments on the rest of the Honorable Mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Springer (NR)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;blasted 20 homers in just 78 games and offers six years of control, but he also struck out once every three plate appearances … &lt;strong&gt;Billy Hamilton (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juan Lagares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;are &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/51231442/v32516883/milcin-hamilton-robs-extra-bases-forced-to-exit/?c_id=mlb"&gt;breathtaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazinavenue.com/2014/9/4/6106957/new-york-mets-juan-lagares-defense-best-plays-of-the-year"&gt;outfielders&lt;/a&gt; who generate so much value with their gloves that they nearly made the cut despite unimposing bats …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Jones (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is a great player who’s a bargain at four years, $62 million, but his .311 OBP is a dagger … &lt;strong&gt;Corey Dickerson (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcell Ozuna (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;will be on next year’s list if their 2015 numbers match their 2014 stats … &lt;strong&gt;Brian Dozier (NR)&lt;/strong&gt; slugged just .387 after the All-Star break, meaning his out-of-nowhere first half might be another Segura situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Seager (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addison Russell (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;just missed earning MLB call-ups last season, but should make an impact soon …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joc Pederson (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Javier Baez (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;got their much-anticipated promotions in 2014, but still carry enough question marks to remain outside the top 50 … &lt;strong&gt;Travis d’Arnaud (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a y&lt;/span&gt;oung, cheap catcher with power and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.statcorner.com/CatcherReport.php"&gt;good defensive skills&lt;/a&gt;, making him an incredible value and the player in this section most likely to make me regret leaving him out of the top 50 …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lorenzo Cain (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;fields like Hamilton and Lagares and would be a top-50 lock if his postseason hitting were bound to carry over into 2015; unfortunately for him and fellow playoff breakout &lt;strong&gt;Eric Hosmer (HM)&lt;/strong&gt;, playoff performance is &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bondsba01.shtml#batting_postseason::none"&gt;highly variant and unpredictable&lt;/a&gt;  because of the small sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 1: Bats!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="edwin-encarnacion-jose-bautista-blue-jays" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/edwin-encarnacion-jose-bautista-blue-jays.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50. Devin Mesoraco (NR), C, Cincinnati Reds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the next two guys on this list,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Mesoraco&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is a potent hitter who offers somewhat limited team control, in his case three more years. Unlike those two,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Mesoraco&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is just entering his prime, heading to arbitration for the first time this offseason. He broke out in his age-26 season, cranking 25 homers in just 440 plate appearances and slugging .534, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=400&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=15,d"&gt;good for 10th&lt;/a&gt; among 209 batters with at least 400 PAs. Also, he’s a catcher, and he topped Buster&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Posey&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and all others at the position in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=c&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=400&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=17,d"&gt;park-adjusted offense&lt;/a&gt; last season. Given Mesoraco’s&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ascent and the pending upheaval in Cincinnati — Johnny&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Cueto, Mat&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Latos, and Mike&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Leake&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;are all a season away from free agency, while trade rumors have swirled around Bruce — expect&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the catcher&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to become a cornerstone for the Reds and a very rich man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;49. Edwin Encarnacion (47), 1B, Toronto Blue Jays&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48. Jose Bautista (NR), RF, Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Anthopoulos&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has made some unfortunate moves as Toronto’s GM, signing Ricky Romero to a long-term deal only to see the lefty fall apart, flipping Mike&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Napoli&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;for Frank Francisco, and stripping the farm system bare with two blockbuster 2012 trades that failed to net playoff teams. But man, the contract extensions he gave&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Bautista&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(in 2011) and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Encarnacion&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(in 2012) look like strokes of genius, leaving the Jays with one of the game’s most potent power combos for tens of millions less than these two would make on the open market. Bautista and Encarnacion are entering their age-34 and -32 seasons, respectively, but they’re also set to make just $28 million and $20 million the next two seasons, including their no-brainer club option years in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 2: Head-Scratchers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="kyle-seager-mariners" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/kyle-seager-mariners.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;47. Kyle Seager (48), 3B, Seattle Mariners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting Seager only one spot might seem like puzzling inertia considering he just signed a seven-year, $100 million extension that will keep him in Seattle through 2021 (or 2022 if the club picks up his option). He would have been first-time arbitration-eligible this winter, positioning him to earn about $30 million over the next three years if he continued to produce at his 2014 level, so the M’s essentially inked him to a four-year, $70 million extension. Since we’re talking about an emerging power hitter who smashed 25 dingers despite playing his home games at pitcher-friendly Safeco Field and who also flashes an impressive glove, that $70 million could look very reasonable for his age-30-to-33 (or 34, with the option) seasons. So while a $100 million price tag might knock most non-household names off the list, it’s a smart investment for a durable player coming off a 5.8-WAR season at a scarce position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46. Jose Altuve (NR), 2B, Houston Astros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what Altuve did in 2014:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Led the majors with a .341 batting average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Led the majors with 225 hits, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/play-index/season_finder.cgi?type=b#gotresults&amp;amp;as=result_batter&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;sum=0&amp;amp;min_year_season=1901&amp;amp;max_year_season=2014&amp;amp;min_season=1&amp;amp;max_season=-1&amp;amp;min_age=0&amp;amp;max_age=99&amp;amp;is_rookie=&amp;amp;lg_ID=lgAny&amp;amp;lgAL_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgNL_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgFL_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgAA_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgPL_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgUA_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgNA_team=tmAny&amp;amp;isActive=either&amp;amp;isHOF=either&amp;amp;isAllstar=either&amp;amp;bats=any&amp;amp;throws=any&amp;amp;exactness=anymarked&amp;amp;pos_4=1&amp;amp;games_min_max=min&amp;amp;games_prop=50&amp;amp;games_tot=&amp;amp;qualifiersSeason=nomin&amp;amp;minpasValS=502&amp;amp;mingamesValS=100&amp;amp;qualifiersCareer=nomin&amp;amp;minpasValC=3000&amp;amp;mingamesValC=1000&amp;amp;number_matched=1&amp;amp;orderby=year_id&amp;amp;c1criteria=H&amp;amp;c1gtlt=gt&amp;amp;c1val=225&amp;amp;c2gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c2val=0&amp;amp;c3gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c3val=0&amp;amp;c4gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c4val=0&amp;amp;c5gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c5val=1.0&amp;amp;location=pob&amp;amp;locationMatch=is&amp;amp;pob=&amp;amp;pod=&amp;amp;pcanada=&amp;amp;pusa=&amp;amp;ajax=1&amp;amp;submitter=1"&gt;most by a second baseman in 78 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Led the AL with 56 stolen bases (in 65 attempts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posted a 7.5 percent strikeout rate, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=5,a"&gt;second-lowest&lt;/a&gt; in the majors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did that all in his age-24 campaign, he’ll be paid a measly $10.5 million total over the next three seasons, and it’s pretty much a lock that the Astros will pick up his 2018 ($6 million) and 2019 ($6.5 million) options, meaning they’ll control his rights through his twenties with no commitment beyond his prime years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why isn’t he even higher? Here’s one NL executive’s assessment: “Different evaluators will treat a player with his unique skill set differently. Certainly a net positive asset value, but not close to my Top 50.” Another talent evaluator (mostly) jokingly called Altuve “Jeff Keppinger with wheels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="357" alt="jose-altuve-jump-swing" width="636" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/jose-altuve-jump-swing_gif_static.gif?w=636&amp;amp;h=357" data-animate="http://i2.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/jose-altuve-jump-swing.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of his gifts, Altuve remains a flawed player. His career walk rate is just 5 percent, which is pretty insane for someone who’s so small that there’s a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.howmanyaltuves.com/"&gt;unit of measurement&lt;/a&gt; named after him. He lashed 47 doubles in 2014 but managed just seven homers in 707 plate appearances. And according to multiple advanced stats, including Ultimate Zone Rating and Defensive Runs Saved, he’s one of the worst defensive second basemen in the majors despite his speed and athleticism. Though he’s an elite base stealer and baserunner, he didn’t become a star until his batting average jumped 58 points, a figure that was largely due to a 44-point jump in batting average on balls in play that’s hard to explain when looking at his &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5417&amp;amp;position=2B#battedball"&gt;stationary line-drive rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to this: If Altuve is really a .340 hitter, he’s probably one of the 20 most valuable commodities in the game. If he’s really a .280-.290 hitter like he was before 2014, he’s a nice fantasy baseball player but little more than a league-average player in real life. And if he’s somewhere in between, he’s no. 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 3: The Kids Are All Right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="byron-buxton-twins" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/byron-buxton-twins.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty ImageS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45. Gregory Polanco (NR), OF, Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44. Jorge Soler (NR), OF, Chicago Cubs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43. Byron Buxton (NR), OF, Minnesota Twins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating young players’ trade value is a fickle exercise. On the one hand, a top minor league prospect offers the incredibly valuable proposition of six years of team control, with three of those years at or near the league-minimum salary. On the other, even the top blue-chippers can’t provide a big league track record, meaning we’re forced to rely on scouting reports and minor league numbers to assess their worth. For every can’t-miss prospect who pans out, there’s a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=milled001las"&gt;Lastings Milledge&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2014-05-20/mlb-draft-2014-busts-worst-prospects-picks-brien-taylor/slide/9"&gt;Brien Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. So while top prospects who are still in the minors or just entering the majors might seem like immensely valuable properties, we have to bake plenty of risk into their evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polanco exemplifies both sides of that coin. &lt;em&gt;Baseball America&lt;/em&gt;’s no. 10 prospect entering the season, Polanco posted video-game numbers at Triple-A to start the year and became a symbol of hope for Pirates enthusiasts eager to see the team build on its first playoff berth in two decades. Those fans grew disgruntled as the calendar turned past Memorial Day, but then a funny thing happened: The Pirates finally called up the 22-year-old on&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;June 10 &lt;/span&gt;… and Polanco stunk, hitting just .235/.307/.343 in 312 plate appearances while occasionally looking less polished defensively than anticipated. What’s more, the toolsy, 6-foot-4, 220-pound right fielder has just 41 homers in 2,000 minor league plate appearances. Still, the upside is considerable: Polanco is pre-arbitration and under team control through 2020, with the skills to blossom into a star who could help give Pittsburgh the most dynamic outfield in baseball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height="336" width="600" src="http://mlb.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=35787511&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=336&amp;amp;property=mlb"&gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soler was never rated as highly as Polanco (let alone Buxton), even getting overshadowed by flashy prospects Bryant, Baez, and Russell within the Cubs system. But he made it to the Show at age 22 last summer and punished the ball, belting five homers, eight doubles, and a triple in just 89 at-bats, with three of those five long balls traveling 420 feet or more. He doesn’t quite have the well-rounded tool set that Polanco and especially Buxton do, but at a time when power is at a premium throughout the majors, the Cubs have a player with major pop who’s ready to be their Opening Day right fielder&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;four months from now&lt;/span&gt; — and take aim at Waveland Avenue for years to come. In 2012, the Cubs signed Soler to a nine-year, $30 million contract, with a clause that would allow him to opt out of the deal and into arbitration when he became eligible. If he continues to hit at anywhere near the level he did in his first brush with the bigs, that’ll surely happen after the 2017 season. In either case, the Cubs control his rights through 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buxton is a couple of weeks shy of his 21st birthday, has exactly three at-bats above Single-A ball, and just completed a 2014 season in which he suffered wrist and shoulder injuries, a concussion, and a dislocated finger. So he obviously carries risk and uncertainty. He’s also a five-tool phenom with off-the-charts speed and defensive ability, plus serious offensive potential. Of all the players in the top 50, Buxton represents the most pure projection, and it’s not particularly close. Consider this ranking a happy medium between the colossal bust or perennial MVP candidate he could become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 4: Where Have You Gone, Brooksie?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="manny-machado-orioles" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/manny-machado-orioles.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jonathan Ernst/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42. Manny Machado (7), 3B, Baltimore Orioles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s six months younger than Bryant, yet he has already established himself as an above-average hitter and off-the-charts fielder capable of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v28689219/balnyy-machado-shows-off-strong-arm-for-great-play"&gt;Brooks Robinson–level feats&lt;/a&gt; at third base. However, two major knee surgeries in the last two seasons have to cast at least some doubt on his future mobility, not to mention durability. Though very few of the players on this top 50 will actually get traded anytime soon, it’s nearly impossible that Machado would. For the O’s, ditching him now would mean giving up on a potentially all-world talent at the worst possible time; for a trade partner, acquiring him now would require taking an enormous leap of faith given the huge return the O’s would want for him, especially since he won’t enter arbitration until after the 2015 season and is under team control through 2018. For now, the best anyone can do is wait and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 5: Imagining a Blockbuster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="xander-bogaerts-mookie-betts-red-sox" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/xander-bogaerts-mookie-betts-red-sox.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsa/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41. Xander Bogaerts (31), 3B/SS, Boston Red Sox&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40. Mookie Betts (NR), CF, Boston Red Sox&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39. Cole Hamels (NR), SP, Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already discussed why the Red Sox &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/boston-red-sox-hanley-ramirez-pablo-sandoval-future-trades/"&gt;threw all of that money&lt;/a&gt; at Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez: Good bats have become really tough to find, the AL East is there for the taking, and Boston can always shop for arms later. Though the free-agent market for starting pitching remains robust with Max Scherzer, James Shields, and ex-Sox Jon Lester still available, rumors indicate that Boston might attempt to address its pitching needs via a big trade — and no trade candidate has garnered more headlines than Hamels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left-hander (who turns 31 on&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;December 27&lt;/span&gt;) has been one of the game’s best pitchers for the better part of a decade, ranking fifth in innings pitched, fourth in strikeouts, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2007&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=19,d"&gt;ninth&lt;/a&gt; in WAR since 2007. He’s durable, he pounds the strike zone, and he carries &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=hamelco01&amp;amp;year=Career&amp;amp;t=p#plato"&gt;virtually no platoon split&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the Sox or any other team could trade for him without worrying about opponents stacking their lineups with right-handed hitters. Though Hamels is a notch below, say, Kershaw, he’s indisputably an ace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe height="390" width="640" allowfullscreen="true" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LyzK5kqEHPk?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" type="text/html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tough question is figuring out what an ace is worth. On the one hand, context matters, and right now the landscape is saturated: In addition to the three top-tier free agents, Jordan Zimmermann, Cueto, Latos, Ian Kennedy, and Andrew Cashner might also be available via trade, and they’re all better-than-average starters who likely won’t be&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;far off Hamels’s level in 2015. On the other hand, Hamels offers four years of team control (and possibly five thanks to his 2019 club option) and won’t cost a team its first-round draft pick as compensation.&lt;a data-footnote-id="13" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/#fn-13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Hamels is owed $22.5 million a year through 2018, which arguably means he can be had at a slight discount compared to his true market value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s probably worth trying to deal for Hamels. The next question, though, is what’s it worth giving up to get him. The Red Sox would undoubtedly prefer to move a player like Yoenis Cespedes, who’s young and talented but under team control for just one more year. But the teams dangling starters — and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11932327/is-right-philadelphia-phillies-trade-cole-hamels"&gt;the Phillies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/mariners-phillies-red-sox-cole-hamels-nelson-cruz-matt-kemp-nick-markakis-hot-stove-111814"&gt;particular&lt;/a&gt; — are understandably more interested in up-and-comers like Bogaerts and Betts, who are 22 years old, pre-arbitration, and under team control through 2019 and 2020, respectively.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notoriously optimistic &lt;em&gt;Bill James Handbook&lt;/em&gt; reckons that Betts, a 5-foot-9, 155-pound dynamo, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.providencejournal.com/sports/red-sox/content/20141104-bill-james-handbook-projects-big-things-from-mookie-betts.ece"&gt;will resemble&lt;/a&gt; peak Wade Boggs next year, projecting him to hit .321/.405/.493. Though the Sox would have to weigh the long-term implications of losing a player as young, talented, and cheap as Betts, they could lose him and still easily populate the outfield next season. They’d have a much tougher time replacing Bogaerts at shortstop, where new signee Ramirez is&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;— repeat not, not, not — the answer. Maybe Bogaerts’s offensive struggles (.240/.297/.362) last season were growing pains stemming from the then 21-year-old being jerked between two positions (short and third). But even though they’re no longer rookies, both he and Betts are still prospects, carrying all the question marks that come with the territory. Meanwhile, Hamels could easily add five wins to the record of whichever team is bold enough to trade for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s tough to see the Red Sox trading Betts or, especially, Bogaerts for Hamels or anyone else, but it’s a fun thought experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 6: Two Years … or Five to Seven?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="stephen-strasburg-nationals" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/stephen-strasburg-nationals.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mitchell Layton/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38. Starling Marte (HM), OF, Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37. Carlos Gomez (33), OF, Milwaukee Brewers&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36. Stephen Strasburg (15), SP, Washington Nationals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marte’s a bit of an odd duck: The talented outfielder is just 26 and is coming off a year in which he hit .291 with a .356 on-base percentage, but he was nonetheless derided for his lousy batting eye by two assistant GMs I spoke with. Tear into the details and that critique starts to make some sense: Marte has struck out nearly five times as often as he’s walked in his first 1,293 major league plate appearances (24.7 percent K rate, 5.1 percent BB rate) and was only marginally better than that in 2014 (24 percent K, 6.1 percent BB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of his on-base success stems from his lofty hit-by-pitch totals: Since Opening Day 2013, he &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=0&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=16,d"&gt;leads the majors&lt;/a&gt; with 41 plunks, ranking just ahead of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/shin-soo-choo-and-the-dark-art-of-hbp/"&gt;HBP dark arts master&lt;/a&gt; Shin-Soo Choo. The thing is, getting hit by pitches is &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=17659"&gt;a real, sustainable skill&lt;/a&gt;, which in Marte’s case could help alleviate some of the issues caused by his poor K/BB rate. Even if his 2014 production represents his ceiling, he still brings tons of speed, rangy defense, solid on-base results, and slightly above-average power at a deep discount, as he’s owed just $26.5 million through 2019, plus $24 million total in 2020 and ’21 if the Buccos pick up his option years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So would a team rather have all of those Marte years, or two years of Gomez or Strasburg?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomez, who turns 29 this week and will earn just $17 million over the next two seasons, is one of the best all-around players in the majors. The Gold Glove–caliber center fielder broke out at the plate in 2013 and has swatted 47 homers and stolen 74 bases over the past two seasons. While single-year defensive stats can be misleading,&lt;a data-footnote-id="14" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/#fn-14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seeing where Gomez ranks among the game’s best players &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=21,d"&gt;by WAR&lt;/a&gt; since 2013 is an eye-opener:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Mike Trout: 18.3&lt;br&gt;
2. Andrew McCutchen: 15.0&lt;br&gt;
3. Josh Donaldson: 14.1&lt;br&gt;
4. Carlos Gomez: 13.4&lt;br&gt;
5. Miguel Cabrera: 13.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="338" alt="carlos-gomez-bat-break-struggle" width="600" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/carlos-gomez-bat-break-struggle_gif_static.gif?w=600&amp;amp;h=338" data-animate="http://i0.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/carlos-gomez-bat-break-struggle.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Strasburg continued his climb toward elite status, setting full-season career bests in 2014 for innings pitched and walk rate to go with his &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=7,d"&gt;nasty swing-and-miss stuff&lt;/a&gt;. He’s just two and a half months older than Marte, making him a rare commodity: a young, healthy, top-of-the-rotation starter. On the other hand, he’s also represented by Scott Boras, all but negating the possibility of a contract extension before he hits the open market following the 2016 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is there more value in getting a handful of cheap years from a player with one of the funkiest skill sets in the league, or two years from legitimate stars destined to hit the open market? It would ultimately boil down to each team’s taste and need, but that doesn’t mean we should stop having the debate.&lt;a href="http://grantland.com/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="html">MLB Trade Value, Part 1</title>
        <published>2014-12-03T06:14:52Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">With the hot stove smoking and the winter meetings looming, it’s time for our annual ranking of baseball’s 50 most valuable assets.&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&amp;amp;blog=60203239&amp;amp;post=195426&amp;amp;subd=espngrantland&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; thousand years from now, when historians look back at the 2014 MLB season and its ties to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq1d07gYl8o"&gt;next big thing&lt;/a&gt;, they’ll focus on two turning points. First, they’ll commemorate &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2014-mlb-playoffs-san-francisco-giants-win-world-series-madison-bumgarner-kansas-city-royals/"&gt;the third&lt;/a&gt; of 50 World Series that the even-year overlord Giants will win over the course of a century. Second, they’ll reflect on Tommy John surgery reaching its peak before giving way to the golden age of pitcher health — and world peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Giants and the Tommy John epidemic have already left lasting impressions in the present day. This was the year that Madison Bumgarner ascended from staff ace to all-time postseason legend, and the year that T.J. surgeries piled up &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/matt-moore-baseball-tommy-john-surgery-historic-rate/"&gt;at a record pace&lt;/a&gt;, felling many of baseball’s brightest young arms. Both occurrences helped spark a big change in the way we view the league’s best players and most valuable commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click here for Part 2 of the 2014 MLB Trade Value column.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on that note, welcome to the third edition of Grantland’s MLB Trade Value, where we’ll try to answer the question that hangs over so many sports debates: Would you trade&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;guy for&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;guy? More than simply listing the best current players with the best current stats, this ranking seeks to account for multiple other factors. Talent and track record matter, but so do age, health, and contract status. The perfect Trade Value player is an established star who’s still young enough to carry growth potential, has no significant injury history,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has an affordable contract that brings numerous years of team control. Ultimately, this is a thought experiment: If every team made every player available via trade, which guys would fetch the greatest return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;h4&gt;More Trade Value Rankings&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/nba-trade-value/"&gt;Bill Simmons on the NBA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/nfl-trade-value/"&gt;Bill Barnwell on the NFL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/mlb-trade-value/"&gt;Jonah Keri on MLB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/tags/trade-value/"&gt;All Trade Value!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;While we’ve used rigorous statistical analysis to help find the answers, this remains a subjective exercise. For instance, when considering the trade value of a 22-year-old mega-prospect with six years of controllable service time (three at the league-minimum salary) versus that of a 10-year veteran who’s widely regarded as the best pitcher in his league and who’s owed nearly $26 million a year for the next five seasons, the answer is in the eye of the beholder. A rebuilding or low-revenue club might jump at the chance to land Kris Bryant, while a richer team gearing up for a playoff push would have a tough time turning down Felix Hernandez.
&lt;p&gt;We’ll do our best to balance all of those factors. We’ll also acknowledge the growing trend of small- and mid-market teams &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/opportunity-knocks-and-opportunity-costs-for-cain-and-votto/"&gt;locking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/mariners-open-the-vault-for-king-felix/"&gt;up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/giancarlo-stanton-miami-marlins-13-year-325-million-contract/"&gt;young stars&lt;/a&gt;, the resulting thinning of the free-agent market, and the corresponding spike in demand for elite players. We’ll call on conversations with executives and talent evaluators from across the sport. And we’ll prepare to read all the hate mail you send to &lt;a target="_blank" href="mailto:grantlandfantasy@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;span&gt;grantlandfantasy@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for the first time, we’ll make minor leaguers eligible for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with a nod to Grantland Trade Value brothers-in-arms &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/nba-trade-value-part-1-2/"&gt;Bill Simmons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-nfl-trade-value-part-1-50-assets/"&gt;Bill Barnwell&lt;/a&gt;, let’s do this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trade Value Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Contracts matter. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Price is a better pitcher than Yordano Ventura, but Price will be eligible for free agency at the end of the 2015 season, while Ventura isn’t even arbitration-eligible yet and will be under team control through 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Age matters. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jose Bautista and Giancarlo Stanton put up similar numbers in 2014, but Bautista is 34 and, as great as he is now, probably won’t be great for too many more years. Stanton is 25 and just starting to harness the full scope of his powers, so he has more trade value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. It’s all relative. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If every team started shopping every player as a trade candidate, which guys would attract the biggest return from any of the other 29 clubs? For instance, if we’re comparing the trade value of Manny Machado and Troy Tulowitzki, we’re not concerned that the Rockies have a solid third baseman of their own in Nolan Arenado, or that the Orioles already have a capable shortstop in J.J. Hardy.&lt;a data-footnote-id="12" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/#fn-12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Instead, we want to know this: If every team were allowed to bid on Machado and Tulo, which player would net the greater return?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Positional scarcity matters. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If a shortstop and first baseman put up comparable offensive numbers, the shortstop is the more valuable player, since it’s much tougher to find someone with the defensive chops to handle short than one who can man first. That’s already accounted for in the Wins Above Replacement metric, which you’ll see referenced occasionally here, but it bears repeating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Defense, park factors, and other variables not immediately apparent in superficial stats matter. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These are not fantasy baseball rankings, so a player who hits 30 home runs isn’t necessarily more valuable than one who hits 20, or even five.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The list runs in reverse order. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If Yu Darvish is no. 17 on this list, it means the Rangers likely wouldn’t trade him for anyone ranked 18 to 50, but would have to at least consider swapping him for the players ranked 16 to 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All contract figures are via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/cots/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cot’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;See Ya: Players Who Fell Out of the Top 50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="matt-carpenter-cardinals" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/matt-carpenter-cardinals.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to this year’s list, here’s a quick rundown of the players we ranked last year (&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/features/mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-2/"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;) who failed to make the cut again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan Braun (no. 50 last year)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;was the most divisive player on the 2013 list following his PED suspension, and whether due to a comedown, injuries, random variance, or all of the above, he wasn’t the same player in 2014 … &lt;strong&gt;Jean Segura&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(49) &lt;/strong&gt;posted a .325/.363/.487 first half and .241/.268/.315 second half in 2013, and the latter proved to be far more predictive … &lt;strong&gt;Adrian Beltre (46)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-often-underappreciated-adrian-beltre/"&gt;a future Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with a legendary fear of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/384851/BeltreHead.gif"&gt;having his head touched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and he barely missed the cut this time despite being 35 and having only one year (plus a vesting option) left on his contract … &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlos Santana (45)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is a valuable hitter even when he bats just .231, and he has a very favorable contract, but an influx of younger talent knocked him off the list …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay Bruce (43)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;was the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=21,a"&gt;fourth-worst&lt;/a&gt; full-time player by WAR in 2014 …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian Desmond (42)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;will be a free agent after the 2015 season …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gio Gonzalez (41)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is no longer cheap …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick Corbin (40)&lt;/strong&gt;, well, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/70090028/ace-lefty-corbin-has-tommy-john-surgery"&gt;oy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Carpenter (37)&lt;/strong&gt;, arguably the toughest omission of all, is a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/how-matt-carpenter-destroyed-the-dodgers/"&gt;pitch-spoiling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=nl&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=14,d"&gt;on-base&lt;/a&gt; machine, one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/batting/_/sort/pitchesPerPlateAppearance/type/expanded/order/true"&gt;the toughest&lt;/a&gt; outs in the game, and under team control through 2020 (including an option year); he also slugged .375 last season and will be just shy of 35 years old when his contract ends … &lt;strong&gt;Matt Moore (34)&lt;/strong&gt; missed most of the year following Tommy John but has such a team-friendly contract that he could claw his way back onto this list next year … &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurickson Profar&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(32)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; boasts an enviable &lt;/span&gt;combination of talent, youth, and affordability, but lost his season to a nasty shoulder injury …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Price (30)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;will be a free agent at season’s end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clayton Kershaw (29)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is still a highly desirable commodity despite the $193 million owed to him over the next six years, but the clause in his contract that grants him free-agency rights at year’s end if he’s traded in-season or the same rights at the end of a full campaign if he’s dealt in the offseason substantially undercut his trade value … &lt;strong&gt;Chris Davis (28)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;just hit .196 …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Verlander (27)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;isn’t Justin Verlander anymore, and paying him $28 million a year over the next five seasons could be a real burden …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Kipnis (25)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is just 27 years old and a good bet to bounce back in 2015, but his 2014 was ugly … &lt;strong&gt;Carlos Gonzalez (24)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;got hurt, &lt;em&gt;again &lt;/em&gt;…&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wil Myers (23)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;regressed badly as a sophomore, but as with Kipnis, we should expect better things ahead … &lt;strong&gt;Dustin Pedroia (22)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; knows that the Red Sox want him to be a lifer, but &lt;/span&gt;that emotional attachment can’t mask his alarming slugging average trend (.493 to .474 to .449 to .415 to .376 over the past five seasons) or the fact that his insistence on playing through injuries, while admirable, hasn’t always helped his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wright (19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;turns 32 later this month and hit eight home runs last season; while he’ll probably knock more balls out of the reconfigured Citi Field next year, he’s no longer a huge bargain … &lt;strong&gt;Miguel Cabrera (9)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is still &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/cabrera-continues-to-make-history/"&gt;an absolute joy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to watch as he &lt;/span&gt;pummels baseballs; his new contract, however, will eventually prove to be &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/detroit-tigers-sign-miguel-cabrera-to-historic-contract/"&gt;an absolute nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Year’s Honorable Mentions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="jacob-degrom-mets" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/jacob-degrom-mets.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim McIsaac/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Todd Frazier (Not Ranked), 3B, Cincinnati Reds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Like Carpenter, Frazier is an excellent hitter at a position light on them. He’s also arbitration-eligible for the first time this winter and under team control for three more years. Kyle Seager just got a $100 million contract from the Mariners, and it’s fair to argue that he, Carpenter, and Frazier, three fairly comparable players, should all be grouped together instead of strewn across three categories. But no one said this was fair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Cobb (Honorable Mention), SP, Tampa Bay Rays; Lance Lynn (NR), SP, St. Louis Cardinals; Tyson Ross (NR), SP, San Diego Padres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; All three of these excellent pitchers are under team control through 2017. A handful of players cracked the top 50 despite offering only two years of control, and it’d be fair to argue that the extra year should count for more. But the gap between nos. 75 and 36 on this list is much narrower than the gap between nos. 35 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob deGrom (NR), SP, New York Mets; Garrett Richards (NR), SP, Los Angeles Angels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; It takes a hell of a lot for a pitcher to make the top 50. DeGrom set the league on fire as a rookie, posting a 2.69 ERA and striking out more than a batter per inning. But hitters &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=140&amp;amp;type=2&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=5,d"&gt;cracked more line drives&lt;/a&gt; off him than against all but 11 pitchers with at least 140 innings, and his minor league track record isn’t nearly as impressive as what he did in 2014. Richards, meanwhile, was easily one of the 10 best starters in the AL on a per-inning basis, and he owns an electric, high-90s fastball that can be nearly unhittable. But he wrecked his knee late in the season, casting some doubt on his ability to be as dominant in 2015, and he’s a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/library/business/super-two/"&gt;Super Two&lt;/a&gt; player who’s arbitration-eligible for the first time this offseason. This might seem like nitpicking, but considering what happened to young stalwarts like Jose Fernandez, Moore, Jarrod Parker, Corbin, and Richards in 2014, it’s also a reminder of how tough it is for pitchers to excel year in and year out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose Quintana (NR), SP, Chicago White Sox; Chris Archer (NR), SP, Tampa Bay Rays; Marcus Stroman (NR), SP, Toronto Blue Jays:&lt;/strong&gt; These three came even closer to making the top 50, with Quintana and Archer signed to incredibly cheap contracts and Stroman posting numbers that rivaled deGrom’s (on a fielding-independent basis) while carrying a better pedigree, being three years younger, and succeeding in the AL. Archer in particular got multiple endorsements from MLB talent evaluators, with one describing him as “young, athletic, cheap, and signed to an extremely reasonable contract,” and another saying, “He fits in the 40-50 range for me with the contract and the stuff.” We just couldn’t find room for them, nor for 2014 breakout pitchers Dallas Keuchel, Matt Shoemaker, Collin McHugh, Phil Hughes, and 10 other names you’re probably shouting at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some rapid-fire comments on the rest of the Honorable Mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Springer (NR)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;blasted 20 homers in just 78 games and offers six years of control, but he also struck out once every three plate appearances … &lt;strong&gt;Billy Hamilton (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juan Lagares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;are &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/51231442/v32516883/milcin-hamilton-robs-extra-bases-forced-to-exit/?c_id=mlb"&gt;breathtaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazinavenue.com/2014/9/4/6106957/new-york-mets-juan-lagares-defense-best-plays-of-the-year"&gt;outfielders&lt;/a&gt; who generate so much value with their gloves that they nearly made the cut despite unimposing bats …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Jones (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is a great player who’s a bargain at four years, $62 million, but his .311 OBP is a dagger … &lt;strong&gt;Corey Dickerson (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcell Ozuna (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;will be on next year’s list if their 2015 numbers match their 2014 stats … &lt;strong&gt;Brian Dozier (NR)&lt;/strong&gt; slugged just .387 after the All-Star break, meaning his out-of-nowhere first half might be another Segura situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Seager (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addison Russell (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;just missed earning MLB call-ups last season, but should make an impact soon …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joc Pederson (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Javier Baez (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;got their much-anticipated promotions in 2014, but still carry enough question marks to remain outside the top 50 … &lt;strong&gt;Travis d’Arnaud (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a y&lt;/span&gt;oung, cheap catcher with power and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.statcorner.com/CatcherReport.php"&gt;good defensive skills&lt;/a&gt;, making him an incredible value and the player in this section most likely to make me regret leaving him out of the top 50 …&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lorenzo Cain (NR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;fields like Hamilton and Lagares and would be a top-50 lock if his postseason hitting were bound to carry over into 2015; unfortunately for him and fellow playoff breakout &lt;strong&gt;Eric Hosmer (HM)&lt;/strong&gt;, playoff performance is &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bondsba01.shtml#batting_postseason::none"&gt;highly variant and unpredictable&lt;/a&gt;  because of the small sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 1: Bats!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="edwin-encarnacion-jose-bautista-blue-jays" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/edwin-encarnacion-jose-bautista-blue-jays.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50. Devin Mesoraco (NR), C, Cincinnati Reds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the next two guys on this list,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Mesoraco&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is a potent hitter who offers somewhat limited team control, in his case three more years. Unlike those two,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Mesoraco&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is just entering his prime, heading to arbitration for the first time this offseason. He broke out in his age-26 season, cranking 25 homers in just 440 plate appearances and slugging .534, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=400&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=15,d"&gt;good for 10th&lt;/a&gt; among 209 batters with at least 400 PAs. Also, he’s a catcher, and he topped Buster&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Posey&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and all others at the position in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=c&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=400&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=17,d"&gt;park-adjusted offense&lt;/a&gt; last season. Given Mesoraco’s&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ascent and the pending upheaval in Cincinnati — Johnny&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Cueto, Mat&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Latos, and Mike&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Leake&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;are all a season away from free agency, while trade rumors have swirled around Bruce — expect&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the catcher&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to become a cornerstone for the Reds and a very rich man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;49. Edwin Encarnacion (47), 1B, Toronto Blue Jays&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48. Jose Bautista (NR), RF, Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Anthopoulos&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has made some unfortunate moves as Toronto’s GM, signing Ricky Romero to a long-term deal only to see the lefty fall apart, flipping Mike&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Napoli&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;for Frank Francisco, and stripping the farm system bare with two blockbuster 2012 trades that failed to net playoff teams. But man, the contract extensions he gave&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Bautista&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(in 2011) and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Encarnacion&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(in 2012) look like strokes of genius, leaving the Jays with one of the game’s most potent power combos for tens of millions less than these two would make on the open market. Bautista and Encarnacion are entering their age-34 and -32 seasons, respectively, but they’re also set to make just $28 million and $20 million the next two seasons, including their no-brainer club option years in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 2: Head-Scratchers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="kyle-seager-mariners" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/kyle-seager-mariners.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;47. Kyle Seager (48), 3B, Seattle Mariners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting Seager only one spot might seem like puzzling inertia considering he just signed a seven-year, $100 million extension that will keep him in Seattle through 2021 (or 2022 if the club picks up his option). He would have been first-time arbitration-eligible this winter, positioning him to earn about $30 million over the next three years if he continued to produce at his 2014 level, so the M’s essentially inked him to a four-year, $70 million extension. Since we’re talking about an emerging power hitter who smashed 25 dingers despite playing his home games at pitcher-friendly Safeco Field and who also flashes an impressive glove, that $70 million could look very reasonable for his age-30-to-33 (or 34, with the option) seasons. So while a $100 million price tag might knock most non-household names off the list, it’s a smart investment for a durable player coming off a 5.8-WAR season at a scarce position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46. Jose Altuve (NR), 2B, Houston Astros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what Altuve did in 2014:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Led the majors with a .341 batting average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Led the majors with 225 hits, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/play-index/season_finder.cgi?type=b#gotresults&amp;amp;as=result_batter&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;sum=0&amp;amp;min_year_season=1901&amp;amp;max_year_season=2014&amp;amp;min_season=1&amp;amp;max_season=-1&amp;amp;min_age=0&amp;amp;max_age=99&amp;amp;is_rookie=&amp;amp;lg_ID=lgAny&amp;amp;lgAL_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgNL_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgFL_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgAA_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgPL_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgUA_team=tmAny&amp;amp;lgNA_team=tmAny&amp;amp;isActive=either&amp;amp;isHOF=either&amp;amp;isAllstar=either&amp;amp;bats=any&amp;amp;throws=any&amp;amp;exactness=anymarked&amp;amp;pos_4=1&amp;amp;games_min_max=min&amp;amp;games_prop=50&amp;amp;games_tot=&amp;amp;qualifiersSeason=nomin&amp;amp;minpasValS=502&amp;amp;mingamesValS=100&amp;amp;qualifiersCareer=nomin&amp;amp;minpasValC=3000&amp;amp;mingamesValC=1000&amp;amp;number_matched=1&amp;amp;orderby=year_id&amp;amp;c1criteria=H&amp;amp;c1gtlt=gt&amp;amp;c1val=225&amp;amp;c2gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c2val=0&amp;amp;c3gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c3val=0&amp;amp;c4gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c4val=0&amp;amp;c5gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c5val=1.0&amp;amp;location=pob&amp;amp;locationMatch=is&amp;amp;pob=&amp;amp;pod=&amp;amp;pcanada=&amp;amp;pusa=&amp;amp;ajax=1&amp;amp;submitter=1"&gt;most by a second baseman in 78 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Led the AL with 56 stolen bases (in 65 attempts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posted a 7.5 percent strikeout rate, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=5,a"&gt;second-lowest&lt;/a&gt; in the majors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did that all in his age-24 campaign, he’ll be paid a measly $10.5 million total over the next three seasons, and it’s pretty much a lock that the Astros will pick up his 2018 ($6 million) and 2019 ($6.5 million) options, meaning they’ll control his rights through his twenties with no commitment beyond his prime years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why isn’t he even higher? Here’s one NL executive’s assessment: “Different evaluators will treat a player with his unique skill set differently. Certainly a net positive asset value, but not close to my Top 50.” Another talent evaluator (mostly) jokingly called Altuve “Jeff Keppinger with wheels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="357" alt="jose-altuve-jump-swing" width="636" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/jose-altuve-jump-swing_gif_static.gif?w=636&amp;amp;h=357" data-animate="http://i2.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/jose-altuve-jump-swing.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of his gifts, Altuve remains a flawed player. His career walk rate is just 5 percent, which is pretty insane for someone who’s so small that there’s a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.howmanyaltuves.com/"&gt;unit of measurement&lt;/a&gt; named after him. He lashed 47 doubles in 2014 but managed just seven homers in 707 plate appearances. And according to multiple advanced stats, including Ultimate Zone Rating and Defensive Runs Saved, he’s one of the worst defensive second basemen in the majors despite his speed and athleticism. Though he’s an elite base stealer and baserunner, he didn’t become a star until his batting average jumped 58 points, a figure that was largely due to a 44-point jump in batting average on balls in play that’s hard to explain when looking at his &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5417&amp;amp;position=2B#battedball"&gt;stationary line-drive rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to this: If Altuve is really a .340 hitter, he’s probably one of the 20 most valuable commodities in the game. If he’s really a .280-.290 hitter like he was before 2014, he’s a nice fantasy baseball player but little more than a league-average player in real life. And if he’s somewhere in between, he’s no. 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 3: The Kids Are All Right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="byron-buxton-twins" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/byron-buxton-twins.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty ImageS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45. Gregory Polanco (NR), OF, Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44. Jorge Soler (NR), OF, Chicago Cubs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43. Byron Buxton (NR), OF, Minnesota Twins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating young players’ trade value is a fickle exercise. On the one hand, a top minor league prospect offers the incredibly valuable proposition of six years of team control, with three of those years at or near the league-minimum salary. On the other, even the top blue-chippers can’t provide a big league track record, meaning we’re forced to rely on scouting reports and minor league numbers to assess their worth. For every can’t-miss prospect who pans out, there’s a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=milled001las"&gt;Lastings Milledge&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2014-05-20/mlb-draft-2014-busts-worst-prospects-picks-brien-taylor/slide/9"&gt;Brien Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. So while top prospects who are still in the minors or just entering the majors might seem like immensely valuable properties, we have to bake plenty of risk into their evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polanco exemplifies both sides of that coin. &lt;em&gt;Baseball America&lt;/em&gt;’s no. 10 prospect entering the season, Polanco posted video-game numbers at Triple-A to start the year and became a symbol of hope for Pirates enthusiasts eager to see the team build on its first playoff berth in two decades. Those fans grew disgruntled as the calendar turned past Memorial Day, but then a funny thing happened: The Pirates finally called up the 22-year-old on&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;June 10 &lt;/span&gt;… and Polanco stunk, hitting just .235/.307/.343 in 312 plate appearances while occasionally looking less polished defensively than anticipated. What’s more, the toolsy, 6-foot-4, 220-pound right fielder has just 41 homers in 2,000 minor league plate appearances. Still, the upside is considerable: Polanco is pre-arbitration and under team control through 2020, with the skills to blossom into a star who could help give Pittsburgh the most dynamic outfield in baseball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height="336" width="600" src="http://mlb.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=35787511&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=336&amp;amp;property=mlb"&gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soler was never rated as highly as Polanco (let alone Buxton), even getting overshadowed by flashy prospects Bryant, Baez, and Russell within the Cubs system. But he made it to the Show at age 22 last summer and punished the ball, belting five homers, eight doubles, and a triple in just 89 at-bats, with three of those five long balls traveling 420 feet or more. He doesn’t quite have the well-rounded tool set that Polanco and especially Buxton do, but at a time when power is at a premium throughout the majors, the Cubs have a player with major pop who’s ready to be their Opening Day right fielder&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;four months from now&lt;/span&gt; — and take aim at Waveland Avenue for years to come. In 2012, the Cubs signed Soler to a nine-year, $30 million contract, with a clause that would allow him to opt out of the deal and into arbitration when he became eligible. If he continues to hit at anywhere near the level he did in his first brush with the bigs, that’ll surely happen after the 2017 season. In either case, the Cubs control his rights through 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buxton is a couple of weeks shy of his 21st birthday, has exactly three at-bats above Single-A ball, and just completed a 2014 season in which he suffered wrist and shoulder injuries, a concussion, and a dislocated finger. So he obviously carries risk and uncertainty. He’s also a five-tool phenom with off-the-charts speed and defensive ability, plus serious offensive potential. Of all the players in the top 50, Buxton represents the most pure projection, and it’s not particularly close. Consider this ranking a happy medium between the colossal bust or perennial MVP candidate he could become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 4: Where Have You Gone, Brooksie?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="manny-machado-orioles" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/manny-machado-orioles.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jonathan Ernst/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42. Manny Machado (7), 3B, Baltimore Orioles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s six months younger than Bryant, yet he has already established himself as an above-average hitter and off-the-charts fielder capable of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v28689219/balnyy-machado-shows-off-strong-arm-for-great-play"&gt;Brooks Robinson–level feats&lt;/a&gt; at third base. However, two major knee surgeries in the last two seasons have to cast at least some doubt on his future mobility, not to mention durability. Though very few of the players on this top 50 will actually get traded anytime soon, it’s nearly impossible that Machado would. For the O’s, ditching him now would mean giving up on a potentially all-world talent at the worst possible time; for a trade partner, acquiring him now would require taking an enormous leap of faith given the huge return the O’s would want for him, especially since he won’t enter arbitration until after the 2015 season and is under team control through 2018. For now, the best anyone can do is wait and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 5: Imagining a Blockbuster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="xander-bogaerts-mookie-betts-red-sox" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/xander-bogaerts-mookie-betts-red-sox.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsa/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41. Xander Bogaerts (31), 3B/SS, Boston Red Sox&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40. Mookie Betts (NR), CF, Boston Red Sox&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39. Cole Hamels (NR), SP, Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already discussed why the Red Sox &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/boston-red-sox-hanley-ramirez-pablo-sandoval-future-trades/"&gt;threw all of that money&lt;/a&gt; at Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez: Good bats have become really tough to find, the AL East is there for the taking, and Boston can always shop for arms later. Though the free-agent market for starting pitching remains robust with Max Scherzer, James Shields, and ex-Sox Jon Lester still available, rumors indicate that Boston might attempt to address its pitching needs via a big trade — and no trade candidate has garnered more headlines than Hamels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left-hander (who turns 31 on&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;December 27&lt;/span&gt;) has been one of the game’s best pitchers for the better part of a decade, ranking fifth in innings pitched, fourth in strikeouts, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2007&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=19,d"&gt;ninth&lt;/a&gt; in WAR since 2007. He’s durable, he pounds the strike zone, and he carries &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=hamelco01&amp;amp;year=Career&amp;amp;t=p#plato"&gt;virtually no platoon split&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the Sox or any other team could trade for him without worrying about opponents stacking their lineups with right-handed hitters. Though Hamels is a notch below, say, Kershaw, he’s indisputably an ace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe height="390" width="640" allowfullscreen="true" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LyzK5kqEHPk?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" type="text/html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tough question is figuring out what an ace is worth. On the one hand, context matters, and right now the landscape is saturated: In addition to the three top-tier free agents, Jordan Zimmermann, Cueto, Latos, Ian Kennedy, and Andrew Cashner might also be available via trade, and they’re all better-than-average starters who likely won’t be&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;far off Hamels’s level in 2015. On the other hand, Hamels offers four years of team control (and possibly five thanks to his 2019 club option) and won’t cost a team its first-round draft pick as compensation.&lt;a data-footnote-id="13" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/#fn-13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Hamels is owed $22.5 million a year through 2018, which arguably means he can be had at a slight discount compared to his true market value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s probably worth trying to deal for Hamels. The next question, though, is what’s it worth giving up to get him. The Red Sox would undoubtedly prefer to move a player like Yoenis Cespedes, who’s young and talented but under team control for just one more year. But the teams dangling starters — and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11932327/is-right-philadelphia-phillies-trade-cole-hamels"&gt;the Phillies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/mariners-phillies-red-sox-cole-hamels-nelson-cruz-matt-kemp-nick-markakis-hot-stove-111814"&gt;particular&lt;/a&gt; — are understandably more interested in up-and-comers like Bogaerts and Betts, who are 22 years old, pre-arbitration, and under team control through 2019 and 2020, respectively.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notoriously optimistic &lt;em&gt;Bill James Handbook&lt;/em&gt; reckons that Betts, a 5-foot-9, 155-pound dynamo, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.providencejournal.com/sports/red-sox/content/20141104-bill-james-handbook-projects-big-things-from-mookie-betts.ece"&gt;will resemble&lt;/a&gt; peak Wade Boggs next year, projecting him to hit .321/.405/.493. Though the Sox would have to weigh the long-term implications of losing a player as young, talented, and cheap as Betts, they could lose him and still easily populate the outfield next season. They’d have a much tougher time replacing Bogaerts at shortstop, where new signee Ramirez is&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;— repeat not, not, not — the answer. Maybe Bogaerts’s offensive struggles (.240/.297/.362) last season were growing pains stemming from the then 21-year-old being jerked between two positions (short and third). But even though they’re no longer rookies, both he and Betts are still prospects, carrying all the question marks that come with the territory. Meanwhile, Hamels could easily add five wins to the record of whichever team is bold enough to trade for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s tough to see the Red Sox trading Betts or, especially, Bogaerts for Hamels or anyone else, but it’s a fun thought experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group 6: Two Years … or Five to Seven?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="576" alt="stephen-strasburg-nationals" width="1024" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/stephen-strasburg-nationals.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=576"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mitchell Layton/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38. Starling Marte (HM), OF, Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37. Carlos Gomez (33), OF, Milwaukee Brewers&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36. Stephen Strasburg (15), SP, Washington Nationals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marte’s a bit of an odd duck: The talented outfielder is just 26 and is coming off a year in which he hit .291 with a .356 on-base percentage, but he was nonetheless derided for his lousy batting eye by two assistant GMs I spoke with. Tear into the details and that critique starts to make some sense: Marte has struck out nearly five times as often as he’s walked in his first 1,293 major league plate appearances (24.7 percent K rate, 5.1 percent BB rate) and was only marginally better than that in 2014 (24 percent K, 6.1 percent BB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of his on-base success stems from his lofty hit-by-pitch totals: Since Opening Day 2013, he &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=0&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=16,d"&gt;leads the majors&lt;/a&gt; with 41 plunks, ranking just ahead of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/shin-soo-choo-and-the-dark-art-of-hbp/"&gt;HBP dark arts master&lt;/a&gt; Shin-Soo Choo. The thing is, getting hit by pitches is &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=17659"&gt;a real, sustainable skill&lt;/a&gt;, which in Marte’s case could help alleviate some of the issues caused by his poor K/BB rate. Even if his 2014 production represents his ceiling, he still brings tons of speed, rangy defense, solid on-base results, and slightly above-average power at a deep discount, as he’s owed just $26.5 million through 2019, plus $24 million total in 2020 and ’21 if the Buccos pick up his option years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So would a team rather have all of those Marte years, or two years of Gomez or Strasburg?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomez, who turns 29 this week and will earn just $17 million over the next two seasons, is one of the best all-around players in the majors. The Gold Glove–caliber center fielder broke out at the plate in 2013 and has swatted 47 homers and stolen 74 bases over the past two seasons. While single-year defensive stats can be misleading,&lt;a data-footnote-id="14" href="http://grantland.com/features/2014-mlb-trade-value-rankings-part-1/#fn-14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seeing where Gomez ranks among the game’s best players &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=bat&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=8&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2013&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=21,d"&gt;by WAR&lt;/a&gt; since 2013 is an eye-opener:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Mike Trout: 18.3&lt;br&gt;
2. Andrew McCutchen: 15.0&lt;br&gt;
3. Josh Donaldson: 14.1&lt;br&gt;
4. Carlos Gomez: 13.4&lt;br&gt;
5. Miguel Cabrera: 13.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="338" alt="carlos-gomez-bat-break-struggle" width="600" src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/carlos-gomez-bat-break-struggle_gif_static.gif?w=600&amp;amp;h=338" data-animate="http://i0.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/carlos-gomez-bat-break-struggle.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Strasburg continued his climb toward elite status, setting full-season career bests in 2014 for innings pitched and walk rate to go with his &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;amp;stats=pit&amp;amp;lg=all&amp;amp;qual=y&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;month=0&amp;amp;season1=2014&amp;amp;ind=0&amp;amp;team=0&amp;amp;rost=0&amp;amp;age=0&amp;amp;filter=&amp;amp;players=0&amp;amp;sort=7,d"&gt;nasty swing-and-miss stuff&lt;/a&gt;. He’s just two and a half months older than Marte, making him a rare commodity: a young, healthy, top-of-the-rotation starter. On the other hand, he’s also represented by Scott Boras, all but negating the possibility of a contract extension before he hits the open market following the 2016 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is there more value in getting a handful of cheap years from a player with one of the funkiest skill sets in the league, or two years from legitimate stars destined to hit the open market? It would ultimately boil down to each team’s taste and need, but that doesn’t mean we should stop having the debate.&lt;a href="http://grantland.com/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">On the anniversary of the first-ever text, the medium deserves our consideration&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&amp;amp;blog=1359921&amp;amp;post=3612277&amp;amp;subd=timedotcom&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The world’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/happy-20th-birthday-text-message-now-past-prime/story?id=17864096"&gt;very first text message&lt;/a&gt;, sent Dec. 3, 1992, was a cheerful, if early, holiday greeting: “Merry Christmas,” it read, short and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two years later, texting has been used to communicate every kind of message there is — but if texts were to send a birthday missive of their own this year, it might be “please save us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text messages, with their character limits and lack of embeddable media, are dying a slow death, getting replaced by more advanced messaging services that can include longer messages photos, videos and, yes, even poop emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s iMessage service, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and similar services all look and act a lot like traditional texts. But, unrestricted by decades-old technological limitations, they are really the evolution of the now-outdated text message, enabled by innovations like smartphones and mobile broadband. Their benefits over SMS? There’s no character limit, you can use them to send lots of photos and videos, t&lt;span&gt;hey’re largely free (save the bandwidth cost in using them) and many of them are platform-agnostic — that is, sending a Facebook Message to an iPhone user looks exactly the same as sending one to an Android user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As any more evolved creature does to its primordial ancestors, these apps are displacing texts. We saw their first victory &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/text-messaging-declines-united-states/"&gt;stateside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2012, a win that was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/01/18/263485395/still-texting-omg-thats-already-so-old-school"&gt;replicated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; just this year over in the U.K. A 2013 &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/chat-apps-to-double-sms-traffic-by-end-of-2013/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Informa, meanwhile, predicted that year’s messaging app traffic would be double its SMS traffic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we shouldn’t start digging text messages’ grave just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMS messages still have a few advantages over their newfangled brethren: &lt;span&gt;It’s often easier to squeeze out a text message when you don’t have good data service, for instance, and they’re a lifesaver if you’re running the risk of going over your mobile data plan. SMS texts are also widely used in parts of the developing world, where smartphones and mobile broadband haven’t seen widespread adoption yet. And SMS messages have gotten more photo-friendly thanks to Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional text messages will stick around for some time; radio didn’t suddenly disappear because TV zapped onto the scene. But as texts start fading into the background on this, their 22nd birthday, it’s worth thinking about how they changed the way we stay in touch: They turned our phones, intended as a means to connect us by voice, into a means to connect us by the written word — Alexander Graham Bell could’ve never seen &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; one coming. And the more-evolved progeny they inspired, with their photos, videos and emoji, mean we’re now just a few smartphone taps from a more intimate form of instantaneous communication than has ever been possible. So thanks, text messages — we couldn’t have gotten here without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&amp;amp;blog=1359921&amp;amp;post=3612277&amp;amp;subd=timedotcom&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/SEI6OiPdpek"&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/your-lawyer-may-soon-be-an-algorithm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.vice.com/motherboard/content-images/article/17358/1417626730332810.jpg?crop=0.8974738246468865xw:1xh;*,*&amp;amp;resize=630:*&amp;amp;output-format=jpeg&amp;amp;output-quality=90"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers are the latest to find themselves in the firing line of robotsor artificially intelligent algorithms, at any rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The robotic revolution has been predicted to spread its techno-tendrils far and wide in the job market, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://jomati.com/reports.html"&gt;a recent report&lt;/a&gt; by UK consultancy firm Jomati Consultants suggests that theyll be &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.legalfutures.co.uk/latest-news/report-ai-will-transform-legal-world"&gt;creeping ever further&lt;/a&gt; into the legal profession by 2030. The report suggests that the economic model of law firms is heading for a structural revolution, some might say a structural collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While robots stealing jobs is nothing new, that lawyers could see their jobs be automated might seem surprising on the surface. In a &lt;a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf"&gt;much-publicised 2013 report&lt;/a&gt; that predicted 47 percent of US jobs were at risk of automation in the next two decades, authors Carl Frey and Michael Osborne put lawyers at comparative low risk of robotic replacement. In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedKingdom/Local%20Assets/Documents/Market%20insights/UK%20Futures/uk-london-futures-agiletown-nov-14.pdf"&gt;recent follow-up&lt;/a&gt; focusing on the UK job market, they also named law as one of the professions at the least risk of roboticization, alongside sectors including financial services and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some jobs in law find themselves at the riskier end of the spectrum. In the 2013 paper, paralegals and legal assistants were ranked around the 100th most at-risk occupation (out of 702) with a computerisable probability of 0.94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thats less surprising; the general trend seems to be that &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/robots-are-coming-for-your-job-but-only-if-youre-poor"&gt;high-paying jobs are much safer&lt;/a&gt; from robotisation than low-paying jobs. The hotshot experienced lawyer dealing with highly unpredictable problems is less replaceable than the legal secretary doing his or her research grunt work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The economic model of law firms is heading for a structural revolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of roles AI could take over in law are evident, and computers have already carved a niche in some tasks. The most obvious are routine tasks like combing through documentssomething a humans eyes and brain find tiresome after a while but a computer has no problem with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be as simple as searching tons of documents for keywords, but more intelligent tools &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/science/05legal.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;can go further&lt;/a&gt;, taking in context and sentiment. Predictive coding algorithms are &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303379204577472633591769336"&gt;increasingly used by lawyers&lt;/a&gt; to help in the discovery processwhen theyre trying to unearth evidence to support their case. For example, imagine combing through a corporation's massive data stores, most of which is probably irrelevant, in search for signs of financial malfeasance. Algorithms are able to sort through for relevant docs based on initial samples given by a human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main attraction for companies is obvious: an algorithm doesnt require a salary and reasonable working conditions, and it can process information a lot quicker. The Jomati report suggests rough figures: a very junior lawyer doing this kind of work might cost $100,000 a year. An AI bot might cost around $500,000, with that price set to fall as the market becomes more competitive. Even at this price they would be worth the cost as they can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with no downtime, thereby eclipsing the chargeable hours of the most workaholic lawyers, the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://jolt.richmond.edu/v17i3/article11.pdf"&gt;a 2011 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Richmond Journal of Law and Technology&lt;/em&gt; found that e-discovery was not only more efficient but also gave better results. Of course, the documents an algorithm picks out still have to be reviewed by a humanbut it reduces the workload, the man hours, and the cost. And the low-level jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even before a case gets rolling, AI can play a part in getting the legal cogs turning. Talking to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/robot_invasion/2011/09/will_robots_steal_your_job_5.html"&gt;Slate earlier this year,&lt;/a&gt; legal technology scholar Daniel Katz proposed that AI may help complainants decide whether its worth going to the hassle and expense of bringing a lawsuitby predicting if theyll win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katz, who works at Michigan State University, recently &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2463244"&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; in which he claimed a computer model was able to successfully predict US Supreme Court decisions 70 percent of the time. The model used only data available prior to the date of decision, effectively comparing similar cases in order to forecast the logical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The number of associates that firms need to hire will be greatly reduced&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in other initiatives, AI is actually helping to make those decisions. A &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829175.900-ai-gets-involved-with-the-law.html#.VH3yrVd4qi0"&gt;New Scientist article&lt;/a&gt; last year described a German application that makes automatic decisions about child benefit payments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI making legal decisions is a compelling idea. Not only is it more efficient, but couldnt it somehow be more just to place decisions in an entity unable to be swayed by bias or emotion? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were not at that point yet, and the lawyers at that kind of high-level decision-making level are the ones with least to worry about in terms of job security. Theyre the ones that have the (so-far) uniquely human talent of keeping clients happy and drawing in new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems more feasible that the career path of lawyers trying to reach those positions could change, if more of the lower steps on the ladderthe more mundane tasks that conventionally act as a training ground for future big dog lawyersare taken over by the bots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of associates that firms need to hire will be greatly reduced, at least if the intention is to use junior lawyers for billable work rather than primarily to educate and train them ready to become business winners, the Jomati consultants predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.seytlines.com/2014/11/the-jay-test-determining-legal-intelligence/"&gt;a recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;, lawyer and consultant Kenneth Grady proposed a law-specific Turing Test to see if an AI would be capable of passing for a newly graduated lawyer when questioned only on the subject of the law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether any recent graduates would dare fill in for the human side of the challenge while their law school debt looms over them is another question.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

There are some exceptions, but for the most part, these tools are used because their security features make up for their boring interfaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wire is part of a growing movement to change that. The service is better-designed than even its insecure competitors, and it’s easier to set up than other secure communications tools. It isn’t perfect — Wire’s decision not to encrypt instant messages sent via the service because it wants to provide search tools is regrettable — but altogether the service has some potential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides, consumers already have a secure, easy-to-use messaging tool available to them: WhatsApp. The company &lt;a href="http://pando.com/2014/11/18/whatsapp-turns-to-open-whisper-systems-for-end-to-end-encryption-that-actually-works/"&gt;rolled out end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt; for all messages sent between its Android users in November, and it plans to expand the feature to other platforms, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between Wire’s release and WhatsApp’s new commitment to digital security, then, it’s clear that secure communications will no longer be the sole province of paranoiacs willing to deal with software that looks like it would have seemed dated when Windows 95 was new. Having to choose between convenience and a modicum of security might soon be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s much more interesting — and important — than the fact that Wire has so many ties to the company it’s trying to replace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Image via Thinkstock]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Nathaniel Mott&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;img height="100" alt="nathaniel" width="100" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/nathan.jpg?w=100&amp;amp;h=100"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Nathaniel Mott is a staff writer for PandoDaily, covering startups and technology from New York. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pando.com&amp;amp;blog=30860228&amp;amp;post=157461&amp;amp;subd=pandodaily&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/4114edba/sc/4/mf.gif" border="0"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/a2.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/214612339869/u/400/f/650422/c/35141/s/4114edba/sc/4/a2t.img" border="0"&gt;</content>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t is not, visually, one of the high points of 2014. The picture is hazy and a little blanched. There is no composition to speak of. The two human subjects are positioned arbitrarily off center in the frame, first at the top, near the elevator doors, then later at the bottom, just under the camera, where the larger subject is standing with his back to the viewer when he throws the punch that drops the smaller subject to the floor. The action has the tinny, slightly sped-up quality of an old silent movie. It looks almost like slapstick. It does, that is, unless you view it in slow motion, in which case it’s punctuated by nightmare strobelike jumps, as though every other frame had been cut out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What We Saw&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, we saw things we've never seen before — things we were never intended to see, things we didn't want to see, things we delighted in, and things we will never forget. The past 12 months were defined by these images. Considering a year this difficult, this beautiful, and this complex requires looking at these images closely — whether we want to or not — and considering why they stubbornly refuse to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;The video is, in other words, pretty much what you’d expect from routine security footage. It’s not trying to be art; there’s no human intelligence behind it. The casino hung a camera in its elevator, like every casino does in every one of its elevators, and among the million snippets of life that the camera happened to capture that week — the texting, the kissing, the embarrassed coughing, the staring straight ahead and waiting for the 12th floor to ring up — it happened to capture the moment when Ray Rice, the star running back for the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens, threw a left hook to the face of his fiancée, Janay Palmer,&lt;a data-footnote-id="7" href="http://grantland.com/features/ray-rice-janay-palmer-elevator-tape/#fn-7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; knocking her out cold, and then, with no particular display of concern, dragged her unconscious body into the hall.
&lt;p&gt;The video was trustworthy precisely because it was so bad. It didn’t look posed. It didn’t feel staged. It hadn’t been lit to emphasize what anyone wanted you to notice. What sight are you most inclined to believe in? The answer is always &lt;i&gt;the one you weren’t supposed to see&lt;/i&gt;. The obvious crappiness of the footage obtained by TMZ was a badge of credibility that preceded any analysis; you knew right away that you were witnessing something unprocessed, unfeigned, unfiltered, and therefore real. Inevitably, because this is 2014, the video that most people saw had, in fact, been edited for clarity, a point that Rice’s lawyers would use in his defense.&lt;a data-footnote-id="8" href="http://grantland.com/features/ray-rice-janay-palmer-elevator-tape/#fn-8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But the first impression was still jarringly real. Which is already a little startling, in 2014, even before you get to the attack. Two decades of sex tapes and reality TV have taught us that the camera’s presence, our presence, changes the way people act. Anytime you see a famous person who’s unaware that the camera is rolling, who has no idea that he’s being watched, there’s this little jolt. Character is what you are in the dark; real is what you are on a surveillance tape with night vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hang on; let’s turn that over for a second. What we’re saying is that hidden-camera video makes a special claim on our belief — which is a little strange to begin with, that what is essentially the record of an act of spying would seem like a natural repository for trust, but OK, life is complicated. But we’re saying that hidden-camera video makes a special claim on our belief because unlike other forms of photography, &lt;i&gt;hidden-camera video doesn’t change anything&lt;/i&gt;. What happens on a hidden-camera tape is exactly what would have happened had there been no tape, because as far as any of the participants know, there isn’t one. The Rice video transformed the public response to the assault, but it was able to do so only because we knew that it hadn’t transformed the assault itself. Roger Goodell, who extended Rice’s suspension indefinitely after the tape’s release, famously said that the video “changed everything,” but it changed everything because it changed nothing. The tape was so powerful because it showed us that we shouldn’t have needed a tape in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe height="390" width="640" allowfullscreen="true" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VbwTMJroTbI?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" type="text/html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;r to put that a slightly different way: How pathetic was our initial reaction to this story? It’s not that there was no outrage over the original two-game suspension, or over the fact that Rice, backed by the NFL, squirmed out of any legal consequences. There was; it simply wasn’t widespread enough to divert the most business-as-usual league in sports from the course of business as usual. It wasn’t loud enough to threaten sponsorships, or to make Goodell think seriously about the single most important issue in football (his own job security). It wasn’t deep enough to force a public consideration of the extent of football’s domestic-violence problem, even though the NFL’s conduct policy was imposed by Goodell’s predecessor explicitly to address that problem, and it certainly wasn’t enough to spread attention to domestic violence beyond the NFL. The outrage wasn’t even enough to create the tumbling tumbleweed of secondary scandal that we dealt with all this fall — what Goodell knew, when he knew it, when he saw the video, what he’d covered up. None of that happened until TMZ released the full tape in September.&lt;a data-footnote-id="9" href="http://grantland.com/features/ray-rice-janay-palmer-elevator-tape/#fn-9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video didn’t tell us anything new. We’d already known that Rice had hit Palmer. But somehow the fact that we could now see the punch, rather than only picture it, took the reaction from intense but still normal-spec cable-channel sports shouting to full-scale cultural meltdown. &lt;i&gt;Ray’s a good guy who made a mistake&lt;/i&gt;, the Ravens and the NFL had gravely assured us; this line felt a lot less comfortable when you were staring at a looping GIF of Ray beating a woman senseless in an elevator. It felt more like what it was, a PR tactic cut-and-pasted by a cynical corporation to keep its product on the shelf. After that, Goodell held a finger to the prevailing winds and realized that he’d better pretend to do something like the pretend leader he is, before the scandal ran away on him; he came up with a procedurally murky indefinite suspension that has just been &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11949855/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-wins-appeal-eligible-reinstatement"&gt;overturned in arbitration&lt;/a&gt;, as everyone knew it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that the dramatic shift in both the public’s and the league’s reaction was prompted by a video that — again! — &lt;i&gt;didn’t change anything&lt;/i&gt;. We already knew what had happened in the elevator; we had already seen the earlier video of Rice dragging Palmer’s body (!) through the doorway. What does it say about the human capacity for sympathy that those facts alone weren’t enough to create more than a midtier public outcry? The absence of a full tape might have enabled men’s-rights paladins to spend the summer flexing in comment-section mirrors about how maybe there was more to the story than we realized,&lt;a data-footnote-id="10" href="http://grantland.com/features/ray-rice-janay-palmer-elevator-tape/#fn-10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but were those guys ever influential outside their home subreddits? It wasn’t Rice’s defenders who had to turn on the NFL before the scandal could blow up. It was the people who cared to begin with, but not all that much; who knew Rice had done something terrible, but were willing to look away from that knowledge as long as the outrage could be made to sound like white noise. It is perilously easy to ignore problems that aren’t right in your field of view. Maybe the most chilling aspect of the tape was that it exposed the depth of that original indifference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tape made indifference impossible. That is: It made indifference impossible in this case. The problem with Goodell’s insistence that “the video changed everything” is that domestic violence is widespread, and most of the time, there’s no camera. The Rice scandal has been credited with starting a national conversation about violence against women. But it’s been a limited conversation, even within football. Think about Joe Mixon, the Oklahoma running back who, in an altercation in a restaurant last summer, punched a fellow student, Amelia Molitor, so hard that he allegedly broke bones in her face. A video of this incident exists. It was shown to the media by police.&lt;a data-footnote-id="11" href="http://grantland.com/features/ray-rice-janay-palmer-elevator-tape/#fn-11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It has been described, by &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/dr-saturday/tape-of-suspended-ou-rb-joe-mixon-punching-woman-shown-to-media-183849393.html"&gt;people who have seen it&lt;/a&gt;. But the city of Norman, Oklahoma, refuses to release it to the public. And because we haven’t seen the tape, we haven’t seemed to care that much about the incident. There will be some indignation if Mixon plays for the Sooners next year. How much more would there be if the world had watched the 6-foot-2, 210-pound Mixon knock a female college student unconscious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Rice tape to help you understand the extent of the domestic-violence problem in the United States, you have to imagine that TMZ kept posting videos — that it posted one two seconds later, in fact, and another one three seconds after that. It started throwing up 24 videos a minute, faster than you could play them, too fast for you to keep up. In three of these videos during the first day, you could watch a woman being murdered by her partner. Then three more on the second day. And so on. You kept playing them; TMZ kept churning out GIFs. You watched a million videos a month. Twelve million in the first year. And the videos kept coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, of course, you watched one video: Rice’s. But these other cases exist. All of them, in overwhelming numbers. And yet when people get angry about Ray Rice, the other cases tend to slip through the cracks, replaced by outrages specific to football. Roger Goodell should lose his job. But if you’re angry enough to want Goodell fired, shouldn’t you be angry enough to think about the other victims of violence? To talk about them? The absence of footage, just as in Mixon’s assault of Amelia Molitor, doesn’t make them any less real. What we saw on the Rice tape was horrifying. But the moral failure wasn’t only Rice’s. It wasn’t only Goodell’s. It’s ours, too, if we can’t bring ourselves to sympathize except when we can see.&lt;a href="http://grantland.com/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&amp;amp;blog=60203239&amp;amp;post=195457&amp;amp;subd=espngrantland&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</content>

        <title type="html">30 for 30 Shorts: Robbed</title>
        <published>2014-12-03T08:00:18Z</published>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://grantland.com/features/30-for-30-shorts-robbed/" type="text/html"/>
        <summary type="html">Our latest film, from Emmy Award–winning director Eric Drath, brings us to the intersection of boxing injustice and urban chaos in the 1970s.&lt;img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&amp;amp;blog=60203239&amp;amp;post=195246&amp;amp;subd=espngrantland&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0"&gt;</summary>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;elcome back to our 30 for 30 documentary short series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976, Muhammad Ali and Ken Norton met inside the ring at Yankee Stadium. The conclusion of the fight would go down as one of the most controversial decisions in boxing. But the civil unrest around Yankee Stadium in the Bronx — and in New York City as a whole — became the story of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s also what makes this documentary short topical, which shouldn’t come as a surprise. Because history always repeats itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the momentous bout — popularly dubbed Ali-Norton III — took place in the stadium, a protest was taking place outside, one that allowed all manner of hostility and criminal activity to occur in the Bronx. The police? They were on strike. And that’s the part of this story that’s difficult to wrap your brain around in the wake of Ferguson. This idea of law officers walking off the job to protest being pushed around, being thought of as second-class citizens, followed by marches, protests, and shows of solidarity obviously has funhouse-mirror echoes in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short, green-lit in October 2013 and planned for this December almost a year ago, was not meant to have a direct parallel to the real world upon release. But now that we’re here, it’s impossible to consider it without acknowledging what has happened in America in the second half of 2014 — the reality that while certain sectors of society have changed, others are very much the same; that there are still voices that feel disenfranchised, easy scapegoats, sectors of society that live with both legitimate and imagined terror. But reconsidering the meaning of this (excellent) documentary in that light is a good thing. Because we need to constantly be reminded of where we come from. And of how far we have, and haven’t, come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, please enjoy Eric Drath’s &lt;em&gt;Robbed.&lt;a href="http://grantland.com/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His Autumn Statement is built on re-announcements of existing projects (including the £15 billion road programme and Bicester Garden City), and re-allocations within existing budgets &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/30271649"&gt;(as with the NHS’s extra £2 billion)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is principled economics as a well as clever politics. The chancellor cannot raise government spending, especially if he wants to offer pre-election tax cuts, because of the overshooting fiscal deficit. Originally promised for 2015-16, a balanced budget now looks hard to reach even for the revised target date of 2017-18. Public sector borrowing, projected in March’s budget to fall to £86.6 billion in 2014-15 (from £98.2 billion in 2013-14) &lt;a href="http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Nov-2014-commentary.pdf"&gt;was actually £3.7 billion higher&lt;/a&gt; in the first half of the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osborne can’t be blamed for this delay in rebalancing the budget – and the resultant longer, &lt;a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/osborne-faces-problematic-autumn-as-borrowing-looks-to-overshoot-8217960.html"&gt;larger rise in UK public debt&lt;/a&gt;. His only mistake was to promise a deficit cut that was not economically feasible. Basic macro-economic accounting makes clear that when the private sector saves more than it invests, and the country can’t export more than it imports, &lt;a href="http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/pn/pn0601.htm"&gt;the government will stay in deficit&lt;/a&gt;, spending more than its taxes bring in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cashing in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain’s households (and the banks they borrowed from) were caught with &lt;a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/pdf/c3.pdf"&gt;excessive debts in 2008&lt;/a&gt; and had to reduce them. A private savings surplus was inevitable unless non-financial companies stepped up their investment. The eurozone crisis quickly ended any chance of the UK reversing its &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/27/britain-current-account-deficit-worst-since-1989"&gt;chronic current-account deficit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the chancellor’s promise of rapid deficit reduction required not only public spending cuts and revenue increases, but also a strong revival in private sector investment. Scope for this existed, in the form of the &lt;a href="http://www.icaew.com/~/media/Files/About-ICAEW/What-we-do/business-confidence-monitor/icaew-business-opinion-cash-surplus-research-2012.pdf"&gt;private business cash piles built up after 2008&lt;/a&gt;. But few firms were ready to spend these – or to borrow for investment – when demand was subdued and credit lines still fragile. Instead, spurning Treasury temptations of lower tax and deregulation, they joined households in saving or paying down debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising that exports and investment couldn’t drive recovery, Osborne took the only other option – crushing the private sector’s inclination to save. Low Bank of England interest rates, below inflation for much of the time since 2008, were a major step towards this. Funding-for-Lending (FLS), which gave commercial banks enough cheap funds to stop them competing for &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20428680"&gt;household deposits&lt;/a&gt; gave a decisive extra push. FLS is now extended for another year, with an additional £500m to support small-business lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Safe as houses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When banks' preference to use FLS for mortgage rather than business lending &lt;a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2013/177.aspx"&gt;led the Bank of England to close this route&lt;/a&gt; the Treasury re-opened it with Help-to-Buy. This enabled low-income households to buy houses with the government lending them a percentage of the price, lowering their down-payment and allowing lenders to provide the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reviving the mortgage flow, these schemes have already lifted house prices close to their &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/03/uk-average-house-price-all-time-high-nationwide"&gt;pre-crisis peak in many areas&lt;/a&gt; – and above it in London. This has enabled owner-occupiers to escape the threat of negative equity without having to save more, and those with capital gains can once again borrow against them. &lt;a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/iadb/fromshowcolumns.asp?Travel=NIxSSxSCx&amp;amp;ShadowPage=1&amp;amp;SearchText=VTYI&amp;amp;SearchExclude=&amp;amp;SearchTextFields=TC&amp;amp;Thes=&amp;amp;SearchType=&amp;amp;Cats=&amp;amp;ActualResNumPerPage=&amp;amp;TotalNumResults=2&amp;amp;XNotes=Y&amp;amp;C=12W&amp;amp;C=E4Q&amp;amp;XNotes2=Y&amp;amp;ShowData.x=33&amp;amp;ShowData.y=12"&gt;The return of “equity withdrawal”&lt;/a&gt; contrasts sharply with the US, where house prices are still well &lt;a href="http://www.housingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CSHomePrice_Release_July-2014-results.pdf"&gt;below their 2005-6 peak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.dontfretaboutdebt.net/news_events/unsecured-debt-rising/"&gt;Unsecured debt is also rising again&lt;/a&gt;, enabling households to spend more despite little real income growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because house buying and building count as as capital spending in the national accounts, these policies appear to have unleashed a long-awaited investment boom. Third-quarter investment was up 7.1% from a year ago, extending what is already the longest upturn since 1998. But this is entirely due to new investment in buildings; spending on capital equipment is &lt;a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/bus-invest/business-investment/q3-2014-provisional-results/index.html"&gt;still falling year-on-year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smash the piggy banks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subdued saving will remain essential to growing GDP and shrinking fiscal deficits, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility. &lt;a href="http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/December_2014_EFO-web513.pdf"&gt;Its latest assessment&lt;/a&gt; shows that the proportion of household income saved, almost 12% in 2010, had halved by 2013. After reviving to 6.6% this year, it is forecast to drop to 4.8% by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can an economy sustain a return to growth and balanced budgets by saving less, rather than investing more? The perilous result is that &lt;a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2724894/Families-red-pose-threat-UK-recovery-household-debt-quadruples-1990.html"&gt;UK household debt has started rising again&lt;/a&gt;, well before public debt starts to fall. Financial and non-financial business debt will also increase if present policies succeed. This makes the UK recovery extremely sensitive to any increase in interest rates, and explains &lt;a href="http://www.schroders.com/tp/home?id=a0j50000009bDHxAAM"&gt;continued reluctance to raise&lt;/a&gt; them despite fears of another asset-price bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As his national infrastructure plan grabs headlines, the chancellor will inevitably be asked why he didn’t step up public investment in 2010, instead of subsidising private investment while discouraging saving. The growing “grey vote” is one reason. Care has been taken to ensure that retirees gain more from &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2699494/Osborne-sets-new-rules-pension-revolution-18-million-told-hands-retirement-lump-sum.html"&gt;rising state pensions and relaxed draw-down rules&lt;/a&gt; than they lose from chronically low annuity rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also hard to explain to voters, in a soundbite, how extra borrowing for investment in 2010 could have brought lower budget deficits by 2015. The “multiplier effect”, driving faster production growth, &lt;a href="http://www.res.org.uk/view/article4Apr12Correspondence.html"&gt;makes this possible&lt;/a&gt;. But the two Eds (Balls and Miliband) in Labour &lt;a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/more-mediamacro.html"&gt;have struggled to convey it&lt;/a&gt;. Osborne’s counter-claim – that costlier homes make us richer – is just as paradoxical, but an easier one to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" alt="The Conversation" width="1" src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/34987/count.gif"&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With many mergers and acquisitions failing to create long-term shareholder value, branding and design can help during the daunting process &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of recent mergers and acquisitions (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/mergers-and-acquisitions"&gt;M&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;) in the media space, such as &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/04/publicis-two-billion-takeover-sapient-omnicom-advertising-media-sales"&gt;Publicis and Sapient&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/10/viacom-channel-5-joint-commissions-takeover-deal-closes"&gt;Viacom and Channel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/i/matrix/the-business-matrix-friday-24-october-2014-9845394.html"&gt;Fetch and Dentsu Aegis Network&lt;/a&gt;. For me, this sparked the question: Can &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/series/brand-marketing"&gt;branding and design&lt;/a&gt; bring clarity and focus to the daunting process of an M&amp;amp;A? The purpose of an M&amp;amp;A is to ensure that brand value is engineered for the long term. Yet, it’s a sobering fact that close to &lt;a href="http://lippincott.com/en/insights/bringing-brand-into-ma-discussions"&gt;seven in 10 M&amp;amp;As&lt;/a&gt; fail to create long-term shareholder value. With this in mind, I have identified five key ways branding and design can help during the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Consider the value of soft factors such as brand from the start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undertaking due diligence of hard factors such as financial, legal and tax savings is clearly fundamental. However it misses the issue of the strategic fit of a potential merger and more importantly how the brand might be the source of potential revenue synergies. Decision makers must be asking the question: “When we own this asset, what are all the ways we can create value with it?” This is what &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/89247.stm"&gt;VW did when it merged with Rolls Royce&lt;/a&gt;, leveraging the high volume Continental GT brand to &lt;a href="http://www.bentleymedia.com/release/118/"&gt;launch the new Bentley Continental GT&lt;/a&gt;, a racy new model priced at £130,000 versus £230,000 for other Bentleys in the range.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/dec/02/branding-design-mergers-acquisitions-business"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

        <summary type="html">&lt;img alt="Big_ef4d61241b" src="http://c3445010.r10.cf0.rackcdn.com/landscape_image/8558/big_ef4d61241b.jpeg"&gt; &lt;br&gt; © Keystone/Getty Images &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is as though a large part of the twentieth century never happened. An entire period is erased from the public consciousness, almost like a blank in a film. The dissolution of the former East-Block is entirely attributed to forces in the West; the role of the East is largely forgotten. The free market economy was and is presumed to be history’s inevitable course, our collective manifest destiny. After having engulfed the West in the 1980s, it was only a matter of time before it would engulf the East too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How accurate is this account of events? Those of us old enough to have witnessed the fall of the Wall mostly remember the overwhelming sense of surprise, the worries that the West was not quite ready for this… Reagan’s call on Gorbachev to “Tear down this Wall”, a few years earlier, was uttered in the firm conviction that he never would. When he did, it was largely met with disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;The Wall did not fall&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had built the wall now demolished it. For a while there was no denying the fact that the dissolution of the East was – at least partially – created in the East; not just through the removal of the Wall, but through a larger reform from within, coupled to crucial proposals for disarmament. It was predominantly this reform that triggered the famous moment of November ’89. Twenty five years later, this version of history (one the remaining powers have never been particularly keen to emphasize) has gradually faded into the background. Even the official historical terminology embodies a curious misnomer: the wall did not ‘fall’; it was torn down. (By the same side that had built it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the construction and demolition of the Berlin Wall feel like parenthesis in a text: whatever is written in between can be removed without fundamentally altering the course of the narrative. The 28 years leading up to ’89 are now widely viewed as time that passed between one pointless act and another. (If you don’t build walls, you don’t have to tear them down.) But how much historic license can be claimed in viewing recent history as expendable text between parentheses? The Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961; the Red Army took Berlin in 1945; the &lt;span&gt;USSR&lt;/span&gt; declared war on Nazi Germany in 1941; the October Revolution took place in 1917; Karl Marx launched the Communist manifesto in 1848… How far do we need to go back? How much of history can we regard as an aberration? Where do we insert the opening parenthesis: 25 years ago? Half a century? A century? …more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the fall of the Berlin wall, the East had been the home of a parallel narrative which spanned half the globe, with its own interpretation of history, a different philosophical disposition to ‘economic inevitability’ and its own particular version of the truth. In the East the Wall was not a symbol of oppression, but a form of protection: an ‘Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart’ to protect a real democratic system, acting out the will of the people, from outside aggression. As a teenager I would listen to the radio and sometimes, when surfing the FM and MW frequencies, I would hear the broadcasts of Radio Moscow, transmitted from East Berlin. I remember being mesmerized by its creative interpretations of the truth – or at least the truth as I had come to view it through Western media: I would hear the same news facts, the same events with the same cast of characters…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they were embedded in completely different discourse, invariably relaying the opposing view with an entirely different and almost always an inverse notion of victims and perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Action against the other truth&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I turned fifty. My life can now be divided into equal halves: half of my life I have lived with the Wall, half of it without. I am old enough to remember the ideological context of its existence, young enough to have a vested interest in its absence. For me it remains an open question if the existence of two parallel systems may have served a purpose beyond the eventual disappearance of one of them. The West, despite fears of an all-out confrontation between the two systems, seemed a less harsh, more humane place then than it does today, particularly to those struggling to keep up in an ever more intense economic rat race. In retrospect, it is not that far-fetched to historically interpret the welfare state, as it existed during the 60’s and 70’s in Western Europe, with labor movements, minimum wages and social provisions, as a kind of pre-emptive action against this ‘other version of the truth’: a way of preventing it from becoming the only truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ironic how today, even with the wall gone, the divide persists, only this time not as a political divide, but as a divide between rich and poor, between opportunity and the lack thereof. This is often explained as the backlash of forty years of communist rule, creating an almost insurmountable economic impairment; but as time passes, that position seems increasingly untenable. It appears the asymmetries produced by the universal presence of an uncontested and unchallenged capitalist system itself are far larger than any asymmetry ever created by the two different ideological systems. The physical wall that once separated the German people seems to have been replaced by an intangible wall, a default inequality no longer subject to any political will (either on the left or the right) to remedy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;A premature sense of closure&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the twentieth century was dominated by ideological oppositions, rooted in highly politicized historic determinisms. But if the course of history is dialectic, what follows? Does the 21st century mark the absence of ideology, of the political? Consensus by way of amnesia? No longer do we hold a regard for the grand social experiments of the last century. We recognize their failure and move on. Through forgetting we hope to avoid repetition and with it the chance of new failures. Yet somehow, in dismissing these experiments as aberrations, we also forego the nature of their deeper quest – the issues which they, for better or for worse, tried to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow the end of the Berlin Wall has granted history a premature sense of closure (the demolition of built structures tends to do that), a ‘happily ever after’ which will not materialize any time soon… History craves for a degree of definitiveness it can never acquire, and somehow that craving condemns us to proceed on the basis of half-truths, which we then take for the whole truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a campaign speech during the primaries of 2008, Obama quoted William Faulkner: “The past is never dead, in fact, it isn’t even past.” At the time he was talking about the history of racial relations in the US. In 2014, 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, this quote seems every bit as true for global relations. Last month there were 19 incursions into &lt;span&gt;NATO&lt;/span&gt; air space by military aircraft of the Russian Federation in a space of 24 hours. Two weeks ago, ironically coinciding with the celebrations in Berlin, the Russian ministry of defense voiced the intention to resume patrols of long range bombers in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the West proceeds on the basis of its half-truths, the East seems increasingly set on claiming theirs. We eradicate the time before 1989, they eradicate the time since. It seems that in the end nothing is unilateral, not even the erasure of history.&lt;/p&gt; by Reinier de Graaf</summary>

What would delight you about having it? [That is] why people spend $500-$1,000 on a watch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smartwatches powered by Google's Android Wear platform let you instantly respond to texts and email by voice, can display directions from Google Maps, and show information about your health among other capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That may sound similar to what the Apple Watch does, but Evans says there's a major difference in Apple's smartwatch strategy versus Google's.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Evans, the Apple Watch is the first smartwatch that truly feels like something you'd want to wear rather than a shrunken computer made to fit your wrist. &lt;span&gt;This, Evans says, is why people would be willing to shell out big bucks on an Apple Watch rather than a competitor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="Apple Watch" src="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/547ddfa7eab8ea283dc4e1f8-857-642/apple-watch-119.png" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest problem, however, is that the market and necessary use cases for the smartwatch are still unclear. Since smartwatches haven't really caught on with mainstream users yet, it's hard to tell exactly what they're best used for, or even capable of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's similar to the way mobile phones have evolved into a whole new form of computing rather than just a means of communicating. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think it's hard to work out an entirely new category, in the same way the iPad was hard to work out,&amp;quot; Evans said. &amp;quot;You have to be concious of what a fundamental change it is. Saying 'I don't need to take out my mobile phone because I have this' is kind of missing the point the same way saying 'I don't need a mobile phone because there are payphones' is missing the point.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="android wear navigation" src="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/547ddfc3eab8ea5139c4e1f2-1200-900/android-wear-navigation.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although Evans had some positive comments to share on the Apple Watch, it's still hard to tell how successful and useful it will be until it launches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The question is whether I'm wearing it six months later or if it's fallen into a drawer,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/basis-peak-review-2014-11"&gt;This Intel-Owned Company Just Made One Of The Best Fitness Trackers You Can Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/benedict-evans-apple-watch-vs-android-wear-2014-12#comments"&gt;Join the conversation about this story »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641537/s/410be7f2/sc/4/mf.gif" border="0"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/a2.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img height="1" width="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/214612299010/u/49/f/641537/c/34800/s/410be7f2/sc/4/a2t.img" border="0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
