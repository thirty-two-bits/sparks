<p>Jason Del Ray, reporting for Recode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Called Amazon Elements, the line of diapers and baby wipes will
only be available to customers who belong to the Amazon Prime
membership program, adding another item to the growing list of
membership perks. By working directly with a manufacturer, Amazon
will be able to price the brand aggressively, with a 40-count
package of diapers starting at $7.99. That works out to about 19
cents a diaper, compared to competitor prices that mostly range
from 24 cents to 34 cents.</p>

<p>As a result, some people will view the launch as a shot across the
bow at the big diaper brands, Huggies and Pampers, that sell their
products on Amazon. Sellers on Amazon already gripe that Amazon
sells the same products as they do. Now it is building a direct
relationship with a supplier that allows it to undercut some of
its own partners in a more significant way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Some people&#8221;? Who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> think this is a &#8220;shot across the bow at the big diaper brands&#8221;?</p>

<p>This afternoon is the Layer Tennis Season 4 Championship: Kelli Anderson vs. James White. Yours truly will be doing match commentary. From my intro:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s the thing: Layer Tennis is grueling. It’s really hard to
come up with clever ideas on the spot &#8212; and not just once, but
five times over the course of an afternoon. Then players have to
implement each idea in just 15 minutes. But they don’t really have
15 minutes, because they squander some chunk of their allotted
time for each volley willing the clever idea into existence. And
no matter how crummy the idea, no matter how rushed the execution,
when the time comes &#8212; and it comes <em>quickly</em> &#8212; the result goes
public, for the world to see.</p>

<p>In the midst of a match, watching the players grind it out, I
sometimes wonder why anyone is willing to play this game.</p>

<p>But then I peruse <a href="http://www.layertennis.com/seasons">the archives</a>. The sweet, wonderful Layer
Tennis archives. Good Layer Tennis matches can be beautiful,
funny, surprising, poignant. The great ones are art. That is why
we play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrap up your workweek and grab some tasty beverages.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mozilla&#8217;s then-CEO <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/15/mozilla-ceo-we-refuse-to-bring-firefox-to-ios-until-apple-lets-us-use-our-web-engine/">Gary Kovacs in April 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most interesting things he spoke about today was why
Firefox has not been released on iOS while Google has offered its
Chrome browser on iOS for some time. He confirmed earlier reports
that Apple was blocking its submission due to Mozilla wanting to
use a different web engine.</p>

<p>“iOS has a policy, generally speaking, where you have to use their
web engine,” Kovacs said. “Our web engine is different. … I would
love to see far more energy behind iOS. We refuse to make the
policy switch.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mozilla VP <a href="https://twitter.com/lsblakk/status/539843892300898304">Jonathan Nightingale, earlier this week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to be where our users are so we&#8217;re going to get Firefox on iOS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/02/firefox-ios-plans/">Via Engadget</a>.)</p>

<p>That it took them until 2014 to bend to practicality &#8212; iOS has been growing in popularity worldwide ever since it debuted, and Apple was never going to allow them to use their own rendering engine in an iOS app &#8212; epitomizes everything wrong with Mozilla as an organization. I&#8217;m all for idealism, but Mozilla has been idealistic to a fault. (Exhibit A: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/03/mozilla_video_mobile">their stance against H.264 video</a>.)</p>

<p>To <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufKFStaFsZs">once again</a> quote the great poet-philosopher Kenny Rogers, &#8220;You gotta know when to hold ’em, know when to fold ’em.&#8221; Their refusal to create an iOS version of Firefox unless they could use their own rendering engine was a losing hand. They&#8217;ve now spent close to a decade bleeding relevance in the only part of the market that is growing: mobile. Compare and contrast with Google&#8217;s iOS version of Chrome. </p>

<p>Practicality wins. I&#8217;ve long suspected that Mozilla&#8217;s leadership didn&#8217;t understand why Firefox beat IE. It wasn&#8217;t because Firefox was idealistically superior &#8212; open source, free of charge, superior support for open standards &#8212; but because it was just plain <em>better to use</em>.</p>

<p>What Nightingale tweeted is exactly right. They need to be where their users are. But their users have been on iOS for seven years. Better late than never, I say &#8212; and it&#8217;s worth noting that Chrome for iOS has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#iOS_version">only been out for two years</a>. But there&#8217;s no logical reason why it should have taken Mozilla this long to make this decision.</p>

<p>This strikes me as a terribly misinformed article. This had nothing to do with rival music stores&#8217; <em>music</em> files, and everything to do with rival music stores&#8217; DRM. The plaintiffs in this class action suit are, from what I&#8217;ve read, deliberately blurring the lines to conflate the two.</p>

<p>Apple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only ever supported one DRM format: FairPlay. They never licensed FairPlay to other device makers or music stores, and never supported any other DRM format in iTunes or on iPods.</li>
<li>Always supported non-DRM music &#8212; in MP3 and AAC formats &#8212; on both iTunes and iPods.</li>
<li>Included DRM on iTunes Music Store tracks at the insistence of the record labels. As famously made clear in Steve Jobs&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/02/reading_between_the_lines">Thoughts on Music</a>&#8221; open letter in 2007, Apple wanted to sell DRM-free music tracks, and, once the record labels allowed them to, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/companies/07apple.html">they did just that</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The thing with Real Networks is that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2004/07/4051-2/">they backwards-engineered FairPlay in 2004</a>, and Apple responded by closing the loopholes Real exploited. If Real had sold DRM-free MP3 files, Apple wouldn&#8217;t have done anything. Amazon&#8217;s music store has always sold music in plain no-DRM MP3 format, and those files have always worked perfectly with iTunes and iPods.</p>

<p>Interesting differences in design. Android Auto is more like a tablet interface; CarPlay is more simplistic &#8212; almost more like Apple Watch than an iPhone or iPad.</p>

<p>Neither of these seems appealing to me, though, at least on this Hyundai. The lag is just atrocious.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://storify.com/gruber/carplay-and-android-auto">Polarized feedback on Twitter</a>. Some are arguing that Apple&#8217;s CarPlay looks like a &#8220;kid&#8217;s toy&#8221;. Others are arguing that Android Auto is too busy to be suitable for use while driving. My favorite was <a href="https://twitter.com/najonezy/status/540281414227599360">this one</a>, from Neil Anthony Jones:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Roger Parloff has an excellent overview of the Apple price-fixing case, including an exclusive interview with Eddy Cue. Here&#8217;s the nut of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In truth, though, anyone complaining about Amazon has a tough row
to hoe. Since the 1970s a broad consensus has emerged that the
only proper purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect
consumers, and low prices are presumed to be the consumer’s
highest priority. Under that regimen, gigantic discounters like
Amazon seem to be golden.</p>

<p>This case may mark the high-water mark in that worldview, with
regulators rushing to the rescue of a near monopolist against the
alleged depredations of a new entrant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key question is who needs antitrust protection here. The DOJ chose to &#8220;protect&#8221; e-book buying consumers from higher retail prices. Apple&#8217;s argument is that it&#8217;s the publishers who needed protection from Amazon. Parloff makes clear that the publishers had no negotiating leverage with Amazon until after the iBooks Store was announced.</p>

<p>One thing that seems clear to me: Apple&#8217;s executive team believes that they&#8217;re in the right here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many are surprised Apple didn’t settle long ago. The case seems to
be more about reputation than money. (Under a conditional
settlement worked out in June, if Apple loses the appeal, it will
pay $450 million in damages and attorney fees. If it wins, it pays
nothing.)</p>

<p>“We feel we have to fight for the truth,” says Cue. “Luckily, Tim
feels exactly like I do,” he continues, referring to Apple CEO Tim
Cook, “which is: You have to fight for your principles no matter
what. Because it’s just not right.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joanna Stern:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The HP Stream 11 runs a full version of Windows 8.1 yet costs only
$200. But wait, there’s more: It also comes with a free year of
Office 365 and 1 terabyte of Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage &#8212; a
$70 value. Buyers even get a $25 gift certificate for the
Microsoft Windows Store. Do the math and this laptop costs $105.</p>

<p>It really does sound like one of those too-good-to-be-true,
TV-shopping network deals, minus, of course, the “four easy
installments” plan and “Call right now!” instructions. But this
isn’t even a holiday special or a clearance deal. It’s Microsoft’s
new strategy to try to destroy Google’s low-cost, cloud-based
Chromebooks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So are Chromebooks gaining traction because they&#8217;re so cheap? Or is it because in some contexts people <em>want</em> simple devices running Chrome OS? I suspect it&#8217;s a little bit of Column A and a little bit of Column B &#8212; and so something like this HP Stream 11 isn&#8217;t going have much of an effect on Chromebooks.</p>

<p>At what point would it be feasible for Microsoft to give away cheap laptops for &#8220;free&#8221; in exchange for a two-year Office 365 subscription?</p>

<p>Chance Miller, writing for 9to5Google:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the latest data from IDC, Google, for the first time
ever, has overtaken Apple in United States schools. The research
firm claims that Google shipped 715,000 Chromebooks to schools in
the third quarter, while Apple shipped 702,000 iPads to schools.
Chromebooks as a whole now account for a quarter of the
educational market.</p>

<p>IDC says that the lower-cost of Chromebooks when compared to iPads
is a huge factor for school districts. Chromebooks start at $199,
while last year’s iPad Air, with educational discounts applied,
costs $379. The research firm also says that many school
corporations prefer the full keyboard found on Chromebooks instead
of the touchscreen found on iPads. Some schools that use iPads,
however, supply students with a keyboard case as well, but that
only further increases the cost of iPads compared to Chromebooks.
IT departments also tend to favor Chromebooks because they are
simpler to manage when compared to iPads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting trend. Makes me wonder whether there are any other markets than education where Chromebooks are gaining traction.</p>

<p>Alistair Barr and Don Clark, reporting for the WSJ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intel Corp. will supply the electronic brains for a new version of

with the matter said, part of a push by the semiconductor giant
into wearable technology. An Intel chip will replace a processor

Glass, the people said.</p>

<p>Intel plans to promote Glass to companies such as hospital

<p>Just the thing Google Glass needs to jump-start sales: blue &#8220;Intel Inside&#8221; decals on the frames.</p>

<p>Ezra Klein, writing at Vox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But on Monday night, St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch
released the evidence given to the grand jury, including the
interview police did with Wilson in the immediate aftermath of the
shooting. And so we got to read, for the first time, Wilson&#8217;s
full, immediate account of his altercation with Brown.</p>

<p>And it is unbelievable.</p>

<p>I mean that in the literal sense of the term: &#8220;difficult or
impossible to believe.&#8221; But I want to be clear here. I&#8217;m not
saying Wilson is lying. I&#8217;m not saying his testimony is false. I
am saying that the events, as he describes them, are simply
bizarre. His story is difficult to believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole thing is absurd. The medical examiner didn&#8217;t take photos of Mike Brown&#8217;s body <a href="https://twitter.com/aurabogado/status/537133810002190336">because his camera ran out of batteries</a>? The fix was so clearly in.</p>

<p>Peter-Paul Koch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out that there are differences between gradients on the
various Android devices. This is <em>not</em> a browser thing, but an
actual device thing. I compared the same gradient test on
different Android devices in Firefox, Android WebKit, and Chrome,
and found the same differences between the browsers. It became
obvious that there are incompatibilities between these Androids’
graphical &#8230; thingies, and that browsers don’t (can’t?) work
around them.</p>

<p>So I thought I’d write a snarky post embellished with some
screenshots. It was when I had made those screenshots that the
other shoe dropped: <em>the screenshots show different gradients than
the screen</em>. In other words, Android screenshots cannot be trusted
to show subtle browser differences. Actual external pictures taken

<p>Paul Ford, writing for The New Yorker:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might have read that, on October 28th, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">W3C officially
recommended HTML5</a>. And you might
know that this has something to do with apps and the Web. The
question is: Does this concern you?</p>

<p>The answer, at least for citizens of the Internet, is yes: it <em>is</em>
worth understanding both what HTML5 is and who controls the W3C.
And it is worth knowing a little bit about the mysterious,
conflict-driven cultural process whereby HTML5 became a
“recommendation.” Billions of humans will use the Web over the
next decade, yet not many of those people are in a position to
define what is “the Web” and what isn’t. The W3C <em>is</em> in that
position. So who is in this cabal? What is it up to? Who writes
the checks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ford achieves something extraordinary with this piece &#8212; it works well as an introduction to the world of web standards for the uninitiated, but works also as a cogent overview for those of us who are intimately familiar with the W3C (idealistic) / WHATWG (practical) political saga.</p>

<p>Ford is on a roll. It&#8217;s amazing how many of my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/11/07/ford-retro-computing">favorite</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/08/14/ford-polite">pieces</a> of the last few months have his byline.</p>

<p>Bryan Jones put the iPhone 6 (regular) display under a microscope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the iPhone 5 came out, Apple bonded the display to the glass
in an effort to get the pixels closer to the surface and Apple has
appeared to make the pixels in the 6 even closer still. Some of
what we are seeing with the iPhone 6 may be a polarizing filter
underneath the glass, but even so, the glass appears thinner and
required less focus distance adjustment to get from the surface of
the glass to the pixel on another microscope. I don’t know what
that precise distance is in microns between the surface of the
glass and the pixels, but it was a shorter distance as judged by
rotation of the focus knob in the iPhone 6 vs. the iPhone 5. What
this accomplishes is making the display appear to be higher
resolution. The blacks are blacker, contrast is higher and colors
are more vibrant, even with the same OS.</p>

<p>My thanks to John Saddington for sponsoring this week&#8217;s DF RSS feed to promote Desk, his blogging app for the Mac. <a href="http://john.do/">Saddington has been blogging</a> for more than a decade, but never found a blogging app that stuck. So, he built one for himself, focused on what matters most: <em>writing</em>. It&#8217;s called Desk, and it&#8217;s exclusively for OS X. (And it has one of the best app icons I&#8217;ve ever seen &#8212; perfect metaphor, beautifully rendered.)</p>

<p>Desk has a simple, writing-focused UI. It supports both Markdown (of course) and WYSIWYG for editing, and has direct posting support for a slew of popular platforms, including WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Typepad, Movable Type, Facebook Notes, and Squarespace. Visually, though, Desk is utterly minimal &#8212; while you&#8217;re writing, everything fades away but your prose.</p>

<p>You can purchase a copy via the <a href="http://bit.ly/deskapp">Mac App Store</a> or check out <a href="http://desk.pm/">Desk&#8217;s beautiful website</a>. Or, follow Desk&#8217;s development through the <a href="http://blog.desk.pm/">Desk App Blog</a> (written using Desk, of course).</p>

<p>Terrific feature by Ian Urbina for the NYT Magazine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several years ago I began asking my friends and family to tell me
their passwords. I had come to believe that these tiny
personalized codes get a bum rap. Yes, I understand why passwords
are universally despised: the strains they put on our memory, the
endless demand to update them, their sheer number. I hate them,
too. But there is more to passwords than their annoyance. In our
authorship of them, in the fact that we construct them so that we
(and only we) will remember them, they take on secret lives. Many
of our passwords are suffused with pathos, mischief, sometimes
even poetry. Often they have rich back stories. A motivational
mantra, a swipe at the boss, a hidden shrine to a lost love, an
inside joke with ourselves, a defining emotional scar &#8212; these
keepsake passwords, as I came to call them, are like tchotchkes of
our inner lives. They derive from anything: Scripture, horoscopes,
nicknames, lyrics, book passages. Like a tattoo on a private part
of the body, they tend to be intimate, compact and expressive.</p>

  <p>I try to instill this into the rest of the team but certainly I

Like, it’s just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer

  <p>Bluetooth Low Energy must be <em>really</em> low power: the design of
WKInterfaceObject means it’s going to be on <em>a lot</em>. Every
interaction with the watch has the potential to move actions and
data between your pocket and wrist using the radio.</p>

<p>But more importantly, this API design gives Apple a simple way to
put a cap on power consumption. We saw this approach in the <a href="http://furbo.org/2008/03/16/brain-surgeons/">early
days of the iPhone</a> and that worked out pretty well, didn’t it?</p>

<p>One final thought about the API design: your code <em>never</em> runs on
the watch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The European parliament is poised to call for a break-up of
Google, in one of the most brazen assaults so far on the
technology group&#8217;s power.</p>

<p>The gambit increases the political pressure on the European
Commission, the EU&#8217;s executive arm, to take a tougher line on
Google, either in its antitrust investigation into the company or
through the introduction of laws to curb its reach.</p>

<p>A draft motion seen by the Financial Times says that &#8220;unbundling
[of] search engines from other commercial services&#8221; should be
considered as a potential solution to Google&#8217;s dominance. It has
the backing of the parliament&#8217;s two main political blocs, the
European People&#8217;s Party and the Socialists.</p>

<p>John Prisco, president of anti-virus software maker <a href="http://www.triumfant.com/default.asp">Triumfant</a>, writing for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple had good intentions. It kept everything close to the vest,
with a closed off development community and rigorous control over
applications. Apple has been brilliant at maintaining the purity
of the brand and until relatively recently, that has been enough
to provide additional protections against malicious attacks. But
the genie is out of the iBottle.</p>

<p>Google, on the other hand, does allow this level of collaboration.
With Android, security professionals can conduct analysis where it
matters &#8212; with operating system-level interrogation and anomaly
detection. With the Apple iOS, you can’t do that. You’re blocked
off. What is then forced is an approach that requires only looking
at the app with the AppWrapper. There is no way to develop a
guardian for the operating system, so you will never be protected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not Apple who is in trouble because iOS doesn&#8217;t allow third-party anti-virus/security software to run at the operating system level. It&#8217;s the purveyors of anti-virus/security software who are in trouble.</p>

<p>Juli Clover, reporting for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has changed the wording for free games in its App Store, and
the app purchase buttons that once read &#8220;Free&#8221; for apps with no
cost now read &#8220;Get&#8221; instead. The change has been implemented on
both the iOS App Store and the desktop App Store. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>It is not entirely clear why Apple has decided to replace Free
with Get, but it may have to do with the growing sentiment that
apps with in-app purchases are not free. Earlier this year, the
European Commission <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/02/27/eu-in-app-purchases/">asked Apple and Google</a> to implement changes to

<blockquote>
  <p>Today Apple unveiled <a href="https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/">WatchKit</a>. I am very pleasantly surprised by
how capable it is. In my <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/11/06/expectations-for-watchkit/">Expectations for WatchKit</a> article I
outlined that I thought we’d see a two phase roll-out of the
platform. Starting with pretty limited capabilities that would
then be expanded at next year’s WWDC. It turns out that I was only
half correct. It is two phase but the first phase is much more
capable than I was expecting.</p>

<p>In the first phase we will be able to build Glances, Actionable
Notifications and iPhone powered apps. The last of which has me
most excited.</p>

<p>Good summary of WatchKit from Serenity Caldwell. Or rather, a good summary of this <em>initial</em> release of WatchKit. As she points out, Apple even stated <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/11/18Developers-Start-Designing-Apps-for-Apple-Watch.html">in its press release yesterday</a>, &#8220;Starting later next year, developers will be able to create fully native apps for Apple Watch.&#8221; The long and short of this initial WatchKit SDK is that the Watch acts as a remote display, with limited interactivity, for code that runs in an extension on your iPhone. Apple Watch&#8217;s system apps are not limited like that &#8212; they run natively on the watch itself. Eventually, third-party apps will too.</p>

<p>In a sense, this is like 2007 all over again. The native APIs almost certainly aren&#8217;t finished, and battery life is a huge concern. But with the Watch, Apple is ahead of where they were with the iPhone. This initial SDK is limited, but it&#8217;s way better than <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote">the shit sandwich</a> we got for the original iPhone at WWDC in 2007.</p>

<p>Ryan Whitwam, writing for Android Police:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Smart Lock in Lollipop encompasses both trusted face and trusted
devices, but a new option is joining the party &#8212; trusted places.
The latest Google Play Services for Lollipop devices is adding
this option to the menu automagically. Just choose a trusted
place, and your phone will remain unlocked when it&#8217;s in that
geographic area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cool feature. <del>I can&#8217;t find it, but</del> I recall suggesting something like this as an iOS feature a year or two ago. Touch ID mitigates the need to some extent, but I still think it&#8217;d be nice to have my iPad remain unlocked while it&#8217;s in my home. (And it&#8217;s going to be a few years until most iOS devices in use have Touch ID.)</p>

<p>Federico Viticci:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Right now, old tweets can be found in search by switching to the
All tab of the Twitter app, and Twitter supports a basic syntax to
filter down tweets for users and dates. I was able to use two
different search operators for usernames and dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>from:username &#8212; load all tweets sent from a user;</li>
<li>since:2009-04-20 until:2009-04-21 &#8212; load tweets from
specific days.</li>
</ul>

<p>Search operators can be used in the Twitter app and combined with
hashtags and text to look more precisely in search results and
find a tweet you&#8217;re looking for. You can even save advanced
searches you come up with and reuse them at any time. And this
makes for a convenient way to delete old tweets as well: find the
tweet, and use the Delete button in the app to remove it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a great feature, and great technical achievement. The entire Twitter archive must be incomprehensibly big.</p>

<p>(Sure would be cool if Twitter made this available to third-party clients.)</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are already slightly more DF readers using one of the iPhones 6 than the iPhone 5/5C/5S combined.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_/status/534794382420213761">this tweet from Dave Rutledge</a>, I figured how to get Google Analytics to show me the split in screen sizes for mobile devices visiting Daring Fireball. Just counting &#8220;mobile devices&#8221; for the last 7 days:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Device</th>
  <th align="right">% Mobile Sessions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="left">320×568 (iPhone 5/5S/5C)</td>
  <td align="right">30.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">768×1024 (all iPads)</td>
  <td align="right">29.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">375×667 (iPhone 6)</td>
  <td align="right">23.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">414×736 (iPhone 6 Plus)</td>
  <td align="right">7.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">320×480 (old iPhones)</td>
  <td align="right">4.1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Those percentages are <em>only</em> for mobile device sessions. (Mobile devices account for 44 percent of all DF sessions.) Two points of interest to me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is more confirmation <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/11/14/iphone6-iphone-6plus">that the split is around 3-to-1</a> between the 6 and 6 Plus. As many readers have pointed out, the 6 Plus is still supply constrained, so the split might tilt back toward the 6 Plus once both of them are available everywhere for immediate purchase.</p></li>
<li><p>There are already slightly more DF readers using one of the iPhones 6 than the iPhone 5/5C/5S combined. You&#8217;re my people.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Bonus Stat #1: iPhone 5 Adoption Back in 2012</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s no way to use screen resolutions to look at last year&#8217;s 5S and 5C launch, because their displays were the same size as the iPhone 5 from 2012. But we <em>can</em> look at 2012 and see the uptake for 4-inch iPhone 5 six weeks after it debuted.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Device</th>
  <th align="right">% Mobile Sessions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="left">768×1024 (all iPads)</td>
  <td align="right">37.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">320×480 (older iPhone)</td>
  <td align="right">30.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">320×568 (iPhone 5)</td>
  <td align="right">26.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In other words, two years ago, 26.2 percent of mobile-device-using DF visitors were using a brand-new iPhone 5. This year, for the iPhones 6 combined, that number is 30.7. Higher, but not drastically so. This could be one of those things where DF readers are very unlike the public at large &#8212; I suspect DF readers have always been the type of people who buy new iPhones as soon as they come out.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more interesting is this. In November 2012, &#8220;mobile devices&#8221; only accounted for 32.7 percent of total sessions; as stated above, today that&#8217;s up to 44 percent. In 2012, the iPad (all models combined) accounted for about 12 percent of DF sessions; today, 13 percent. So it&#8217;s roughly flat. (DF traffic overall is roughly flat too.) iPhones accounted for about 19 percent of <em>all</em> traffic to DF back in 2012; today that number is <em>29 percent</em>. The growth in mobile usage among DF readers over the last two years is almost entirely from the iPhone.</p>

<h2>Bonus Stat #2: OS Usage</h2>

<p>While I&#8217;m looking at DF&#8217;s web stats, here&#8217;s the OS usage for all sessions (not just mobile) for the last week:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">OS</th>
  <th align="right">% Total Sessions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="left">iOS</td>
  <td align="right">44.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Mac OS X</td>
  <td align="right">39.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Windows</td>
  <td align="right">12.6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Android</td>
  <td align="right">2.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">&#8220;Linux&#8221;</td>
  <td align="right">1.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Windows Phone (<em>sad trombone sound</em>)</td>
  <td align="right">0.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Far from killing it, native apps have made the open web even stronger.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Christopher Mims, writing in the WSJ, &#8220;<a href="http://on.wsj.com/11hUNbi">The Web Is Dying; Apps Are Killing It</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything about apps feels like a win for users &#8212; they are
faster and easier to use than what came before. But underneath all
that convenience is something sinister: the end of the very
openness that allowed Internet companies to grow into some of the
most powerful or important companies of the 21st century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe someone is still writing this in 2014. Users love apps, developers love apps &#8212; the only people who don&#8217;t love apps are pundits who don&#8217;t understand that apps aren&#8217;t really in opposition to the open Internet. They&#8217;re just superior clients to open Internet services. Instagram didn&#8217;t even have a web interface for years, but native app clients for iOS and Android didn&#8217;t lock Instagram into anything. Their back-end is just as open as it would have been if they had only had a web browser client interface. They just wouldn&#8217;t have gotten popular.</p>

<p>I spoke about this four years ago at O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Web 2.0 conference, in a talk titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Z_Eq95LvA">Apple and the Open Web: A Love Story</a>&#8221;. The gist of it being that native iOS apps (and native apps for Android, Mac OS X, Windows, and everything else) aren&#8217;t in opposition to the &#8220;web&#8221;. They live on top of the web. A new layer. They are alternatives to websites that run in web browsers. They&#8217;re just better clients. There are two big four-letter &#8220;H&#8221; acronyms that powered the web from the beginning: HTML (client) and HTTP (networking protocol). Native apps are just an alternative to HTML running in a web browser (and many native apps still use HTML web views embedded within the apps themselves to render parts of their interface). Almost all native apps use HTTP/S for networking, though. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s just a conceptual simplification. Instead of a web app running inside a browser running as an app inside an OS (three levels of abstraction), we just have apps running within an OS (two levels). Simpler, easier, more elegant.<sup id="fnr1-2014-11-17"><a href="#fn1-2014-11-17">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Mims continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take that most essential of activities for e-commerce: accepting
credit cards. When Amazon.com made its debut on the Web, it had to
pay a few percentage points in transaction fees. But Apple takes
30% of every transaction conducted within an app sold through its
app store, and “very few businesses in the world can withstand
that haircut,” says Chris Dixon, a venture capitalist at
Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s patently false. Even with Mims&#8217;s own example, Amazon. Just a few minutes before sitting down to write this piece, I used Amazon&#8217;s iPhone app &#8212; the one distributed through Apple&#8217;s App Store &#8212; to buy some stuff. I added items to my cart, signed in with my getting-close-to-two-decades-old Amazon account, and I was done. Apple won&#8217;t see one penny of that transaction. Not one.</p>

<p>If Amazon started using Apple Pay in their app, Apple would have gotten a fraction of a penny of each dollar I spent &#8212; but those pennies would have come from my credit card company, not Amazon.</p>

<p>Retailers who sell through native apps do not pay Apple anything, let alone 30 percent. What Apple charges 30 percent for are purchases for <em>in-app digital content</em>. I can&#8217;t buy Kindle books in the Kindle app, or Amazon MP3 music, because of this &#8212; but I can buy everything else from Amazon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Web was intended to expose information. It was so devoted to
sharing above all else that it didn’t include any way to pay for
things &#8212; something some of its early architects regret to this
day, since it forced the Web to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/technology/personaltech/banner-ads-the-monsters-that-swallowed-the-web.html?_r=0">survive on advertising</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says the guy writing for the site with a rather strict paywall.</p>

<p>And exposing information, freely, is where the web continues to thrive (says me, the native app proponent who publishes everything I write on a freely-accessible website). If something works great as a web app, let it be a web app. (There are some great web apps, perfectly suited for what they are.) If something works better as a native app, let it be a native app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Web wasn’t perfect, but it created a commons where people
could exchange information and goods. It forced companies to
build technology that was explicitly designed to be compatible
with competitors’ technology. Microsoft’s Web browser had to
faithfully render Apple’s website. If it didn’t, consumers would
use another one, such as Firefox or Google’s Chrome, which has
since taken over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight. Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer &#8220;was explicitly designed to be compatible with competitors’ technology&#8221;. I can&#8217;t wait until Jeffrey Zeldman reads this. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-06/jeffrey-zeldman-king-of-web-standardsbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">From a 2007 Businessweek profile of Zeldman</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This concept may seem obvious today, but during the Browser Wars
of the 1990s, Microsoft and Netscape each claimed close to
50% of the market, and their browsers were almost entirely
incompatible. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to type in a URL and find that
the site didn&#8217;t work. Companies eager to open their virtual doors
had to invest in multiple versions of their sites. In short, it
was a bad situation for businesses and consumers alike. Yet the
browser makers were behaving as many software companies do &#8212; by
trying to out-feature the competition with the introduction of new
proprietary technologies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to Mims:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In a lot of tech processes, as things decline a little bit, the
way the world reacts is that it tends to accelerate that decline,”
says Mr. Dixon. “If you go to any Internet startup or large
company, they have large teams focused on creating very high
quality native apps, and they tend to de-prioritize the mobile Web
by comparison.”</p>

<p>Many industry watchers think this is just fine. Ben Thompson, an
independent tech and mobile analyst, told me he sees the dominance
of apps as the “natural state” for software.</p>

<p>Ruefully, I have to agree. The history of computing is companies
trying to use their market power to shut out rivals, even when
it’s bad for innovation and the consumer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How has the rise of native mobile apps been anything but a renaissance of innovation? I&#8217;d argue we&#8217;ve seen far more innovation in the iPhone era (2007-2014) than from 2000-2007. I can&#8217;t see how anyone would argue that we&#8217;ve seen <em>less</em> innovation. We used to print driving directions from mapping websites; now we get audible turn-by-turn directions on our devices. The pre-mobile web was largely about consumption for most people: reading articles, watching videos, buying stuff. In today&#8217;s world, everyone is creating and sharing their own content &#8212; everything from photos to videos to their thoughts and observations. Mims claims native mobile apps are &#8220;bad for innovation and the consumer&#8221; while consumers around the world are doing remarkably innovative things using native mobile apps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That doesn’t mean the Web will disappear. Facebook and Google
still rely on it to furnish a stream of content that can be
accessed from within their apps. But even the Web of documents and
news items could go away. Facebook has announced plans to host
publishers’ work within Facebook itself, leaving the Web nothing
but a curiosity, a relic haunted by hobbyists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is where Mims most betrays his conflation of client software and &#8220;the Web&#8221;. For the sake of argument, imagine a world where all native apps went away. A world where we do everything through web browsers like Safari, Chrome, Mozilla, and IE. In that world, Facebook could do exactly the same thing &#8212; &#8220;host publishers&#8217; work within Facebook itself&#8221;. Exactly the same thing. The control Facebook is exerting here has nothing to do with native mobile apps in particular. They&#8217;ve <em>always</em> locked non-Facebook users (like me) out of most content posted to Facebook. Now they&#8217;re just talking about hosting even more Facebook-only content.</p>

<p>Arguments about &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; often devolve into unresolvable cross-talk where the two sides have different definitions of what <em>open</em> and <em>closed</em> really mean. But the weird thing about a truly open platform is that its openness allows closed things to be built on top of it. In broad strokes, that&#8217;s why GNU/GPL software isn&#8217;t &#8220;open&#8221; in the way that BSD software is (and why Richard Stallman <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">outright rejects</a> the term &#8220;open source&#8221;). If you expand your view of &#8220;the web&#8221; from merely that which renders inside the confines of a web browser to instead encompass all network traffic sent over HTTP/S, the explosive growth of native mobile apps is just another stage in the growth of the web. Far from killing it, native apps have made the open web even stronger.</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Superficially, iOS and Android seemingly converged toward flatness (and Windows Phone, of course, was there already), but once you get past those surface similarities, all three mobile platforms are evolving in noticeably different ways.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>New today: updated Android apps <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/a-new-day-for-google-calendar.html" title="Official Gmail Blog: A New Day for Google Calendar">for Google Calendar</a> and <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/a-more-modern-gmail-app-for-android.html" title="Official Gmail Blog: A More Modern Gmail App for Android">Gmail</a>. Both look interesting &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/529380058238947328" title="Tweet from Benedict Evans.">as Benedict Evans succinctly put it</a>, “Google is reworking Mail and Calendar from database displays to task-led interfaces. I wonder how far they&#8217;ll take that.” </p>

<p>And intriguingly, as Google&#8217;s new &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec" title="Google’s Material Design spec">material&#8221; design</a> language evolves, it&#8217;s very clearly heading in a different direction than iOS. Talking about <em>flatness</em> is simply too superficial to be a useful discussion. Superficially, iOS and Android seemingly converged toward flatness (and Windows Phone, of course, was there already), but once you get past those surface similarities, all three mobile platforms are evolving in noticeably different ways.</p>

<p>But Google’s “Material Design” isn’t merely the design language for Android, it’s the design language for all the company’s software. One result of this is that Google&#8217;s iOS apps feel less and less like iOS apps with each major release. To me, they look and feel like Android apps running on iOS. Android users might disagree with that assessment, as much of what makes a good Android app Android-y is not how the software <em>looks</em> but the way it interacts with the system. But these Google apps certainly don’t look or feel quite like iOS apps. Their brand-new you-need-a-beta-invitation <a href="http://www.google.com/inbox/">Inbox app</a> is also interesting (I got an invitation last week), but even though it&#8217;s a brand-new app, if anything, it feels <em>less</em> like an iOS app than Google’s other iOS apps. For one thing, Inbox uses a blue background for the status bar, which is the system-standard cue to indicate that cellular tethering is engaged. Another example: None of the Google iOS apps I have on my iPhone (Maps, Gmail, Inbox) support the iOS standard swipe-from-left-edge shortcut to go back in the view hierarchy. That&#8217;s a two-year-old standard design pattern for iOS, and I find it downright essential with the bigger displays on the new iPhones. (In hindsight, it seems fairly obvious that Apple added this gesture in iOS 7 because they knew then that bigger-screen iPhones were in the pipeline.)</p>

<p>One last thought. Lost in the competition between platforms (iOS vs. Android) is the more philosophical competition between native and in-browser web apps. In the early days of iOS, say, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/11/iphone_web_apps_alternative" title="Yours truly, back in 2009: “iPhone Web Apps as an Alternative to the App Store”">circa</a> 2008-2011, it was easy to conflate these two battles in public debate, because Apple was seen as the primary proponent of native app development, and Google was seen as a proponent of cross-platform web apps. No more. Google today (like Facebook) seems all-in on native apps, at least (again, like Facebook) for post-PC devices. Just a few years ago, I used to see a lot more arguments from web-app proponents that native apps&#8217; dominance on mobile devices would be short-lived. I don&#8217;t see so much of that any more.</p>

<p>One reason some people argue in favor of in-browser HTML/CSS/JavaScript web apps is that it&#8217;s the last bastion for <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere">write-once-run-everywhere</a></em>. The lament I hear most frequently about mobile development is that if you want to reach the widest possible audience, you have to write at least two apps, iOS and Android. If you include Windows Phone, now you&#8217;re up to three. My take has always been: Tough luck. The point of making apps shouldn&#8217;t be about making life easier for developers, it&#8217;s about making the best possible apps for users. If you value user experience above developer convenience, it&#8217;s easy to see why native apps are winning the war. But even on the desktop, with PC browsers, write-once-run-everywhere is often just a pipe dream. <a href="/misc/2014/11/wally-world-is-closed.png">Here&#8217;s the screen I see</a> when I try to log into the desktop web app version of Google Inbox using Safari on OS X Yosemite.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the web version of Inbox is Chrome-only because Google wants to lock people into Chrome. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about spite. I think it was just a practical decision that fell out of a desire to push the limits of the in-browser web app experience, rather than limit themselves to a common baseline of functionality available across the <em>X</em> top browsers. Cynics surely look at this as the second coming of Microsoft&#8217;s IE-only web technologies from the late &#8217;90s, but my guess is that support for additional browsers <em>is</em> coming, that Safari is probably high on that list, and they shipped Chrome-first only because it was the fastest way they could ship. One reason Google created Chrome in the first place was to have a browser they controlled to better enable the sort of web apps they wanted to build.</p>

<p>In short, though, a Chrome-only app from Google &#8212; even if only temporary &#8212; is not how the world of standards-supporting web apps was supposed to work, in the aftermath of the breakup of Microsoft&#8217;s IE hegemony. But I’m not surprised. Practicality trumps idealism in the long-run, and the idea that the post-IE world of web browsers would lead to a world of universal cross-platform software is pretty much the definition of an idealistic crusade.</p>

<p>I see a certain irony in all this. Google is cultivating a single look-and-feel for their apps. But for mobile they’re creating them as separate native Android and iOS apps. But their latest web app for desktop PCs, Inbox, only runs in one browser, Chrome.</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Think about what they&#8217;re doing. They&#8217;re turning off NFC payment systems &#8212; the whole thing &#8212; only because people were actually using them with Apple Pay.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/25/cvs-disabling-nfc-apple-pay/">Eric Slivka, reporting for MacRumors</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Earlier this week, pharmacy chain Rite Aid shut down unofficial
support for the Apple Pay and Google Wallet mobile payments
systems, resulting in an outcry from users who have been testing
out Apple&#8217;s new system since its launch on Monday. Rite Aid was
not an official Apple Pay partner, but the payments system
generally works with existing near field communications (NFC)
payment terminals anyway, and many users had had success using
Apple Pay at Rite Aid stores early in the week.</p>

<p>It now appears that fellow major pharmacy chain CVS is following
suit and as of today is shutting down the NFC functionality of its
payment terminals entirely, a move presumably intended to thwart
Apple Pay. Google Wallet services are obviously also being
affected by the move.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These retailers are part of a group (Merchant Customer Exchange, &#8220;MCX&#8221;) working on an upcoming mobile payment system called CurrentC. <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:D5TrmxYz-qsJ:mainstreetinc.net/currentc-mobile-payments-alternative/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">Here&#8217;s an article about CurrentC by Debbie Simurda</a>, writing for Mainstreet Inc., a point-of-sale provider:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CurrentC mobile payments platform by Merchant Customer Exchange
(MCX) is a mobile wallet being developed by a group of major
retailers who want greater control of payments, their mobile brand
and mobile customer experience. They want to keep more of their
customer data, rather than ceding to technology companies. MCX was
established in 2012 and currently consists of 59 participating
retailers, many large Tier 1 merchants, across all segments. [&#8230;]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> Not sure why, but Mainstreet Inc. took down the original article. I&#8217;m now linking to Google&#8217;s cached version of it.]</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s supposed to work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The application can be downloaded for free from the App Store and
Google Play Store. Available for both iOS and Android devices, it
is designed to ‘simplify and expedite the customer checkout
process by applying qualifying offers and coupons, participating
merchant rewards, loyalty programs and membership accounts, and
offering payment options through the consumer’s selected financial
account, all with a single scan.”</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using CurrentC mobile payments the point-of-sale displays a QR
code for the customer to read with their phone.</p></li>
<li><p>The QR code generates the payment token on the smartphone which
verifies the shopper’s presence, identity and initiates the
transaction between the merchant and the bank.</p></li>
<li>The phone connects with the cloud for authorization and sends
the approval to the merchant.</li>
</ul>

<p>CurrentC doesn’t support the contactless Near Field Communications
(NFC) used by Apple Pay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>QR codes. Good luck with that. Plus, CurrentC doesn&#8217;t even work with credit cards &#8212; it only works with prepaid store cards and debit cards tied directly to your bank account. Apple Pay is built atop the credit card system; CurrentC is a (futile, I say) attempt to eliminate credit card.</p>

<p>What Apple gets and what no one else in the industry does is that using your mobile device for payments will only work if it&#8217;s far easier and better than using a credit card. With CurrentC, you&#8217;ll have to unlock your phone, launch their app, point your camera at a QR code, and wait. With Apple Pay, you just take out your phone and put your thumb on the Touch ID sensor.</p>

<p>Tim Cook was exactly right on stage last month when he introduced Apple Pay: it&#8217;s the only mobile payment solution designed around improving the customer experience. CurrentC is designed around the collection of customer data and the ability to offer coupons and other junk. <a href="https://twitter.com/fromedome/status/526027483901333505">Here is what a printed receipt from CVS looks like</a>. It looks like a joke, but that&#8217;s for real. And that&#8217;s the sort of experience they want to bring to mobile payments.</p>

<p>If I&#8217;m reading this right, and I think I am, these retailers who are shutting down their NFC payment systems are validating that Apple Pay is actually working, that people are actually using it. And remember, it only works with the month-old iPhones 6. Think about what happens a year or two from now when a majority of iPhones in use are Apple Pay enabled.</p>

<p>Think about what they&#8217;re doing. They&#8217;re turning off NFC payment systems &#8212; <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/leaked-rite-aid-docs-say-apple-pay-may-never-come-24352383/">the whole thing</a> &#8212; only because people were actually using them with Apple Pay. Apple Pay works so well that it even works with non-partner systems. These things have been installed for years and so few people used them, apparently, that these retailers would rather block everyone than allow Apple Pay to continue working. I can&#8217;t imagine a better validation of Apple Pay&#8217;s appeal.</p>

<p>And the reason they don&#8217;t want to allow Apple Pay is because Apple Pay doesn&#8217;t give them any personal information about the customer. It&#8217;s not about security &#8212; Apple Pay is far more secure than any credit/debit card system in the U.S. It&#8217;s not about money &#8212; Apple&#8217;s tiny slice of the transaction comes from the banks, not the merchants. It&#8217;s about data.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re doing this so they can pursue a system that is less secure (third-party apps don&#8217;t have access to the secure element where Apple Pay stores your credit card data, for one thing), less convenient (QR codes?), and not private.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know that CVS and Rite Aid disabling Apple Pay out of spite is going to drive customers to switch pharmacies (Walgreens is an Apple Pay partner), but I do know that CurrentC is unlikely to ever gain any traction whatsoever.</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t think performance is any longer a reason to buy a MacBook Air instead of an iPad Air. The choice comes down to form factor and personal preference. This marks a turning point.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The relationship between the iPad and the iPhone, performance-wise, has been hard to predict. I often point out that Apple is a company of annual patterns, often predictable. There&#8217;s not much of a pattern with regard to how the iPad and iPhone relate to one another.</p>

<p>Two years ago, when the original iPad Mini debuted, it was roughly a year behind its 9.7-inch sibling, the iPad 4. The original Mini had a non-retina display and A5 system-on-a-chip (SoC). In broad strokes, Apple took an iPad 2 and shrunk it to fit in a much smaller form factor. The iPad 4 had a retina display and an A6 SoC &#8212; and double the RAM (1 GB vs. 512 MB), a better camera, etc.</p>

<p>Last year, the new models were roughly all on par CPU/GPU-wise, with the A7 SoC running at about the same speed on all three devices: iPad Air, iPad Mini 2, and iPhone 5S. The Air had one small advantage over the other two devices: it was clocked at 1400 MHz instead of 1300 MHz, which gave it <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/ios-benchmarks">about a 5 percent advantage in CPU performance</a>. The iPhone 5S had unique niceties, though, maintaining its clear position as the king of the iOS hill: a far superior camera and Touch ID, to name just two. The Air had better color gamut than the Mini, but I think it was very fair to say (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/11/the_retina_ipad_mini">which I did</a>) that they were more or less the same iPad in two different sizes. The main thing you got when you paid the extra $100 for last year&#8217;s Air (versus the comparably-equipped Mini) was the size of the display.</p>

<p>This year, all previous patterns are busted.</p>

<p>The new iPad Mini 3 really just gets two things: Touch ID and a gold case option. Really, that&#8217;s it. Everything else about it remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The iPad Air 2, though, is entirely new. It&#8217;s a thorough refresh, that not only makes it a nice year-over-year improvement over last year&#8217;s iPad Air in just about every single regard, but arguably positions it above the iPhones 6 as the top-tier iOS device, period.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s talk performance. The iPhones 6 still have just 1 GB of RAM. The iPad Air 2 has 2 GB. The iPhone&#8217;s A8 SoC has 2 billion transistors and two cores. The iPad Air 2&#8217;s A8X SoC has 3 billion transistors. According to <a href="http://www.primatelabs.com/geekbench/">Geekbench 3</a>, Apple achieved this by going from two CPU cores to three. And the Geekbench benchmark results bear this out:</p>

</table>

<p>(The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are so nearly identical in Geekbench results that I simply averaged the two together under &#8220;iPhones 6&#8221;.)</p>

<p>The Air 2 is noticeably faster than the iPhones 6 in single-core performance, but it&#8217;s simply in an altogether different ballpark in multi-core. I couldn&#8217;t get an answer from anyone at Apple regarding whether Geekbench is correct that it&#8217;s a three-core CPU,<sup id="fnr1-2014-10-21"><a href="#fn1-2014-10-21">1</a></sup> but the multi-core results certainly bear that out.</p>

<p>It is remarkable not only that the new iPad Air 2 is faster than the iPhones 6, but also that it&#8217;s faster than a three-year-old MacBook Air, and within shooting distance of a two-year-old MacBook Air. It&#8217;s more than half as fast as today&#8217;s top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro, especially in multi-core. (Let&#8217;s not get carried away regarding this apparent third core. Single-core performance is a better measure for most of the things typical consumers do on an iPad. But still.)</p>

<p>Geekbench is just a benchmark, but I think it&#8217;s a fair one for a general comparison of &#8220;how fast&#8221; machines are, including machines that run entirely different operating systems.</p>

<p>But Geekbench only measures CPU performance &#8212; year-over-year, the iPad Air 2 is even more impressive in terms of GPU performance. <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air-2/performance/">Apple claims</a>, &#8220;The A8X chip has an astonishing 2.5 times the graphics performance of the A7 chip,&#8221; and from what I&#8217;ve seen, that&#8217;s true.</p>

<p>The iPad is no longer following in the wake of the iPhone, performance- and specs-wise. It&#8217;s forging ahead. With 2 GB of RAM, it&#8217;s a year ahead of the iPhone (we hope) in that department. Performance-wise it&#8217;s fast enough to replace a MacBook Air for many, many people. The demos that Apple chose for last week&#8217;s event &#8212; the <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a> image editor and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/replay-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8">Replay</a> real-time video editor &#8212; emphasize that. Those are performance-heavy tasks, and the iPad Air 2 handled them with aplomb.</p>

<p>The other factor is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/">Metal</a>, Apple&#8217;s new low-level graphics API, which is (at least for now) iOS-only. Apple promotes it as being 10 times faster than OpenGL. For games and creative productivity apps that take advantage of Metal &#8212; and developers of both seem to be buying in &#8212; the iPad Air 2 might be on even footing <em>today</em> with the MacBook Air. It really is desktop-PC-level performance.</p>

<p>In short, I don&#8217;t think performance is any longer a reason to buy a MacBook Air instead of an iPad Air. The choice comes down to form factor and personal preference. This marks a turning point.<sup id="fnr2-2014-10-21"><a href="#fn2-2014-10-21">2</a></sup></p>

<h2>iPad as Camera</h2>

<p>The original iPad in 2010 <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP580">didn&#8217;t even <em>have</em> a camera</a> &#8212; not on the front, not on the back. Now, the iPad Air 2 has both a FaceTime camera and a rear-facing (&#8220;iSight&#8221;) camera that, to my eyes, produces images with quality somewhere between that of the iPhone 5 and 5S. It suffers in low light compared to the 5S, but in sunshine, it&#8217;s pretty close.</p>

<p>Apple didn&#8217;t anticipate people loving to use their iPads as cameras. I certainly didn&#8217;t either. But they do, and now Apple is embracing iPad photography. And for whatever the iPad Air 2 camera lacks optically, it makes up for many things through software. Again, I think the Pixelmator/Replay demos were carefully chosen &#8212; not only did they show off the Air 2&#8217;s computational performance, they exemplified the sort of apps you might want to use if you&#8217;re using the iPad as a camera. Shoot, edit, filter, publish and share &#8212; <em>all from one device</em>. You can do the same from an iPhone too, but other than the optical quality of the camera (where the iPhone 6 still has a noticeable edge), the iPad is the better machine for everything else. It&#8217;s faster, and its bigger display is better for composing new shots and examining/editing the shots you&#8217;ve already taken.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s the social aspect. The iPad camera has spawned an entirely new class of applications for teachers and coaches. Apple showed a clip of <a href="http://coachseye.com/">Coach&#8217;s Eye</a> during the event last week, to name one very popular example. The iPad&#8217;s size enables a teacher and pupil, a coach and player, to share the display in a way that isn&#8217;t practical on a phone (even the 6 Plus).</p>

<p>When the iPad debuted in 2010, the primary question was what sort of things  would we want to use them for instead of our iPhones and laptops. The answers vary by taste. Email, web browsing, watching video &#8212; a lot of the things we used to do on phones and laptops we now do on tablets.</p>

<p>Using the camera, in conjunction with smart software, as an instructional aid is something else: brand-new territory. Something only a tablet is suited for.</p>

<h2>Feel</h2>

<p>The iPad 3 was the first to go retina, and it was glorious to behold. But at 1.46 pounds, it was not so glorious to just plain <em>hold</em>. Not only was that 50 grams heavier than the iPad 2, it was 0.6 mm thicker. Apple products get thinner and lighter over time, not thicker and heavier. (The iPad 4, released just six months after the 3, was the same size and weight. It had better performances and switched the 30-pin adapter (gross, right?) for Lightning.)</p>

<p>Two years later, the iPad Air 2 is an entire half pound lighter than the iPad 3 was (0.98 pounds, down from 1.46) and 33 percent thinner (6.1 mm, down from 9.4 mm). A one-third reduction in thickness and weight in just two and a half years &#8212; with the same battery life, incredible performance increases (see above), and vastly improved cameras. The camera quality deserves special recognition, because, all things considered, the image quality of a camera tends to be inversely proportional to the distance between the lens and the sensor. (That&#8217;s why the iPhone 6 has a lens that juts out from the back of its frame.)</p>

<p>Yet the iPad Air 2 got thinner and its camera quality has increased. Part of that is that now that Apple is taking iPad photography more seriously, they&#8217;re using more expensive camera components. But part of it is due to things other than the camera lens and sensor. Face detection for auto-focus goes through the A8X&#8217;s image signal processor (presumably, the same ISP as on the iPhones 6), and the ISP plays a major role in noise reduction, burst mode, slo-mo, and more.</p>

<p>The end result is a markedly improved iPad, just in terms of it being an object you hold in your hands. It really does feel like we&#8217;re getting close to just holding a piece of glass. It&#8217;s very thin, very light, and very comfortable to hold. The improved display is a noticeable improvement over all previous iPads. Retina iPhone displays have been laminated to the glass touch screen ever since the first retina model (the iPhone 4, back in 2010). It really does feel like the difference between pixels-under-glass and pixels-on-glass. Now the iPad Air 2 offers the same thing, and it&#8217;s gorgeous. Even better, the iPad Air 2 one-ups the iPhone 6, with an anti-reflective coating. It&#8217;s quite noticeable, and very welcome. On a dark screen, it&#8217;s the difference between being able to see a reflection of my own face on the display, and being able only to see a silhouette of myself. I hope and expect this anti-reflective coating to spread to next year&#8217;s new iPhones and iPad Mini. The anti-reflective coating appearing on the iPad Air 2 first is another sign that the &#8220;new&#8221; iPhone is no longer the recipient of all new model-year improvements.</p>

<p>One other change is worth noting in the Air 2: Apple removed the &#8220;side switch&#8221; above the volume buttons. It was an on/off toggle that could be set to function as either a silent switch or a rotation lock (configurable in Settings). Now, it&#8217;s gone, and both those functions can only be controlled via the swipe-up-from-the-bottom-of-the-screen Control Center. I only ever used it as a silent switch, but I did use it. I&#8217;m curious what Apple&#8217;s rationale was for getting rid of it, because I thought it was useful.</p>

<h2>Personal Preference</h2>

<p>Everything Apple is promoting about the Air 2 is true, both in terms of what you can objectively measure, and in terms of how it feels to use it. It&#8217;s thinner, lighter, faster, and has a better display and better camera. And, yes, Touch ID is great, especially if you&#8217;ve been using it for the last year on your iPhone.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to buy one, though.</p>

<p>For the last two years, my day-to-day iPad has been a Mini. I like the Mini form factor so much that I switched to the original non-retina model in late 2012 even after having used the retina iPad 3 for six months or so. In terms of visual acuity, that was painful. In terms of hold-ability, though, it was a huge win. Last year I didn&#8217;t hesitate to stick with the Mini form factor once it went retina.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time in this review comparing the new Air 2 to the iPad 3/4. I think that&#8217;s fair, because normal people aren&#8217;t supposed to even consider replacing their iPads on an annual basis. And <a href="http://qz.com/284335/tim-cook-in-his-own-words-on-why-the-ipad-has-a-bright-future/">from what we&#8217;re learning as the iPad era marches on</a>, iPad users aren&#8217;t even upgrading them as often as they do their iPhones. They&#8217;re more like PCs, where people use them for several years. Anyone upgrading from an iPad 3/4 to an iPad Air 2 is going to be delighted. Anyone upgrading from an iPad 2 or original iPad is going to be amazed.</p>

<p>If you already have an iPad Air, it&#8217;s obviously a closer call. From the outside, Touch ID looks like the biggest change, but I&#8217;d actually rank it behind the improved display (lamination and anti-glare) and CPU/GPU performance in terms of how big a difference it makes in use. And the biggest change of all might be the  reduction in weight and thickness. If you hold your iPad for long stretches of time, it really makes a difference.</p>

<p>But I still prefer the Mini form factor. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s better in general &#8212; only that it&#8217;s better for me, personally. More than anything else, I mostly read on my iPad. When I do type on my iPad, I tend to do it iPhone-style with just my thumbs. For reading, the Air comes close to being a better iPad for me. After just four days of testing it, my iPad Mini already feels a little thick. But for typing, I&#8217;m far more comfortable with the Mini.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the new iPad Mini 3. Apple loaned me one of those to test alongside the Air 2. There&#8217;s really not much to review, though. Touch ID and the gold color option really are the only differences from the last year&#8217;s iPad Mini 2. Here&#8217;s what I wrote last year, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/11/the_retina_ipad_mini">in my review of the then-new iPad Air and iPad Mini 2</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the iPad Air is an excellent year-over-year update over the
iPad 4 &#8212; double the performance, and a serious reduction in
size and weight. But the retina iPad Mini is an almost
unbelievable year-over-year update &#8212; four times the
performance, a retina display (which therefore means four times
the pixels), and yet no appreciable difference in size or
weight. This is the iPad Mini I expected to see next year, in
2014. But here it is today, in my hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out I was right &#8212; we did get this year&#8217;s iPad Mini a year early. And now we still have it. But that&#8217;s OK. I think the sort of person who prefers the Mini form factor is less likely to be using their iPad in the ways that the iPad Air 2 is improved. (Anecdotally, most <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrogFRt8fE&amp;feature=youtu.be">iPad photographers</a> I see in the real world are using 9.7-inch iPads, not the Mini.) And the sort of iPad users who are pushing the performance limits of the platform are the sort of people who&#8217;ve preferred the 9.7-inch models all along. In short, I think the Mini really is more of a pure consumption device, and the Air is more of an alternative to a MacBook.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Model</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/cgpgrey/status/522810078454620160">criticism</a> that Apple now offers too many iPad models to choose from. The array of iPads for sale &#8212; three generations, two sizes, four storage tiers (16/32/64/128), and cellular-vs.Wi-Fi-only &#8212; is certainly not simple. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that tough for a would-be iPad buyer to decide. I&#8217;d say there are only four questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What size &#8212; Mini or Air?</li>
<li>What color?</li>
<li>Cellular?</li>
<li>How much more money do you want to spend?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you answer yes to question 3, you have to answer another question: Which carrier? But with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/16/apple-sim-details-and-potential/">Apple SIM</a>, that&#8217;s no longer a long-term commitment unless you choose Verizon.</p>

<p>Question 4 is the tricky one, because you have to evaluate multiple factors, all of which cost additional money: performance, Touch ID, thinness/weight, and of course storage capacity.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not so much that Apple has complicated the iPad lineup, as that they&#8217;ve <em>expanded</em> it downward into lower price points. They now have models ranging from $249 (the A5-based original iPad Mini, a.k.a. <a href="http://www.allenpike.com/2014/the-ipad-zombie/">the zombie iPad</a>) to $829 (the 128 GB cellular Air 2). At any given price point, there aren&#8217;t many decisions to make beyond color. I don&#8217;t know that that&#8217;s any harder a decision to make than buying a MacBook, especially once you factor in the various build-to-order upgrades that MacBooks offer.</p>

<h2>Storage Tiers</h2>

<p>On that last point, I&#8217;ll reiterate <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/10/ios_8_storage_space">what I wrote a few weeks ago</a> regarding the iPhone lineup. Apple should not be selling 16 GB iPads. The starting tier for typical consumers should be 32 GB. There&#8217;s just not enough usable space on a 16 GB iOS device to do the things Apple has worked so hard to make easy to do. High-def slo-mo video? Panoramic photos? Console-quality games? Those things all consume large amounts of space.</p>

<p>I heard from a few DF readers in education and the enterprise who said that their organizations buy 16 GB iPads and they all have plenty of free space to spare. It&#8217;d be a waste to force them to buy 32 GB models. I have no doubt that&#8217;s true. And I have no doubt there are millions of consumers for whom 16 GB is more than enough storage. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s enough for the majority of <em>typical</em> iPad users, and that&#8217;s what matters.</p>

<p>I also understand the product marketing angle. That there are a lot of people who will look at the 16 GB models, see that they can get four times the storage for just $100 more, and buy the 64 GB model instead &#8212; when they would&#8217;ve bought the base model if it were 32 GB. I get it. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind it&#8217;s good short-term business sense to go with a 16/64/128 lineup instead of 32/64/128. But Apple is not a short-term business. They&#8217;re a long-term business, built on a relationship of trust with repeat customers. 16 GB iPads work against the foundation of Apple&#8217;s brand, which is that they only make good products.</p>

<p>Apple has long used three-tier pricing structures within individual product categories. They often used to label them &#8220;Good&#8221;, &#8220;Better&#8221;, and &#8220;Best&#8221;. Now, with these 16 GB entry-level devices, it&#8217;s more like &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;, &#8220;Better&#8221;, and &#8220;Best&#8221;. Fine, keep the 16 GB models around for expert business and education buyers who know that they really don&#8217;t need more storage space. But don&#8217;t put devices on the tables in Apple retail stores that you wouldn&#8217;t recommend as a good product and good value to typical customers.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re on the fence about buying a 16 or 64 GB new iPad, especially the Air 2, I strongly encourage you to spring the extra $100 for the 64 GB. You&#8217;ll thank me later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apple claims that the A8X has three billion transistors, compared to two billion on the iPhone 6&#8217;s A8. Is that because it includes a third core?&#8221;</p>

<p>These CPU and GPU performance gains are all thanks to Apple&#8217;s own in-house chip design team. And Metal is all-Apple. They&#8217;re not sharing these chips or APIs with anyone else. It could well turn out to be a temporary historical blip, but at the moment, it looks like one company, Apple, is single-handedly pulling away from the entire rest of the industry in terms of computing performance and efficiency.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2014-10-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
